Dataset and code accompanying manuscript. 

The Dataset is provided here in JSON format, or can be made available on Baserow (at the moment).
The scripts demonstrate how to import and clean the data either from baserow, or json. 

The code imports and cleans data as above, and provides some preliminary analysis. 

The data itself is from the Parliamentary Committee Inquiry into genAI in Education in Australia, and used under a cc-by-nc-nd license.
