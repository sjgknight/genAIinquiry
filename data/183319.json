Beyond a desire to encourage responsible experimentation and the development of an informed and critical awareness of the benefits and risks of GenAI, an important factor in taking this position is that detection of AI-generated content is unlikely to be feasible. Emerging evidence suggests that humans are not reliable in detecting AI- generated content. Equally, AI detection tools are non-transparent and unreliable in their testing and reporting of their own accuracy, and are likely to generate an intolerably high proportion of both false positives and false negatives. The exception to detection difficulties is where watermarks are injected. Watermarks are coded patterns of output that are intentionally detectable to AI detection systems. To make this system feasible would require the regulation of all GenAI technologies to mandate the injection of watermarks into their content. Unregulated GenAI technologies would allow students to avoid this. Other GenAI technologies can be used to parse watermarked content to remove the watermark. Humans can inject watermarks into human-generated content to discredit detection technologies.","Sources":[{"id":3,"value":"3"}],"Lookup":[{"id":3,"value":"Monash University"}],"Tags":[{"id":977295,"value":"mandatory-watermarking","color":"green"}],"Addresses-risk":[],"Address-challenge":[],"Tags_lookup":[{"id":5,"value":"mandatory-watermarking"}],"Created on":"2023-07-26T03:57:21.446229Z","test":[]},{"id":6,"order":"6.00000000000000000000","Recommendation":"Clarity around the responsible use of GenAI in assessment is necessary to help students navigate uncertainty and to make them responsible for their own academic conduct.","Sources":[{"id":3,"value":"3"}],"Lookup":[{"id":3,"value":"Monash University"}],"Tags":[{"id":977292,"value":"guidelines","color":"dark-blue"}],"Addresses-risk":[],"Address-challenge":[],"Tags_lookup":[{"id":2,"value":"guidelines"}],"Created on":"2023-07-26T03:57:49.720215Z","test":[]},{"id":7,"order":"7.00000000000000000000","Recommendation":"Alternative approaches to assessment will be needed, in which a combination of assessment of process, closer working relationships with students, and more complex assessments will need to be developed.

There are now myriad, educationally-grounded proposals for how ChatGPT might be used â€” what is missing is the coordinated tracking of evidence of how well these work across different contexts. â€¢ How do we build critical AI literacy among students of different ages and stages, such that it becomes a lifelong capability, and does not age rapidly with technical advances? â€¢ What are the most effective ways to upskill academics, short and longer term? Every university has a centre for teaching innovation bringing wide expertise, including Academic Language and Literacies, Library, Course Program Design, Assessment Design. All of these have been engaged in the rapid response to generative AI over the last 6 months, but there has not yet been time to consolidate, share and discuss innovations. â€¢ How do we tune generative AI for learning? The dominant Large Language Models and conversational interfaces were not developed for education. These can be further tuned with in-depth disciplinary texts, and prompt engineering to shape learning conversations. Some universities are beginning to build the infrastructure to conduct such applied R&D, while others will depend on them sharing the outputs in forms they can adopt and adapt, open source or via commercial products.","Sources":[{"id":71,"value":"71"}],"Lookup":[{"id":71,"value":"University of Technology Sydney (UTS)"}],"Tags":[{"id":977964,"value":"evidence-generation","color":"dark-purple"}],"Addresses-risk":[],"Address-challenge":[],"Tags_lookup":[{"id":21,"value":"evidence-generation"}],"Created on":"2023-07-30T05:13:12.117368Z","test":[]},{"id":147,"order":"145.00000000000000000000","Recommendation":"Staff will however need institutional support and resources to achieve this, including greater workload allocations for course design and student assessment and frameworks for considering what types of AI usage might constitute plagiarism.

As for the use of any new technology, it will be necessary to think through regulatory compliance and broader ethical considerations. Developments internationally should be monitored carefully, particularly for regulatory responses applicable to education providers.\nQuality, ethical outputs from GAI require quality inputs. Australian higher education can help ensure GAI is fit for purpose - avoiding inaccurate, irrelevant, biased, or deceptive outputs, or information that is counter to either regulatory or teachersâ€™ pedagogical design. This can be done by undertaking ongoing due diligence to ensure the inputs of GAI are relevant to educational settings, and that the outputs of GAI in education settings are robust, ethical, increase the quality of learning outcomes, and are protecting the reputation of Australian education. GAI systems will need appropriate controls to allow educational institutions to undertake this work. Misconduct is also a known risk, where some students may pass off AI-generated work as their own. Widespread evidence from within the field of academic integrity suggests that students are well-intentioned but may be opportunistic when under pressure. Misconduct - both unintentional and intentional - can be mitigated when education institutions provide students and teachers with clear advice and guidance and sanctioned alternatives, including appropriately-trained GAI, as trusted, readily-accessible options. Risks and challenges can be mitigated with transparency of use. Policy should dictate that where a student or researcher uses GAI tools this should be disclosed to assessors, reviewers, and other audiences, just as referencing is used to disclose access to archive materials.","Sources":[{"id":27,"value":"27"}],"Lookup":[{"id":27,"value":"Studiosity"}],"Tags":[{"id":977872,"value":"monitoring-impacts","color":"dark-gray"},{"id":977964,"value":"evidence-generation","color":"dark-purple"}],"Addresses-risk":[],"Address-challenge":[],"Tags_lookup":[{"id":21,"value":"evidence-generation"},{"id":25,"value":"monitoring-impacts"}],"Created on":"2023-08-04T05:40:01.553436Z","Note":"","test":[]},{"id":495,"order":"473.00000000000000000000","Recommendation":"Implemented well, GAI has the potential to improve access to and the accessibility of learning and enhanced learning outcomes for disadvantaged learners.

such as academic integrity concerns and workload issues.2.Foster a culture of transparency, collaboration, and partnership between educators, students, and AI experts, to ensure that AI is used ethically and effectively.3.Develop evidence-based support systems and guidelines for AI use in education, and regularly update them to keep up with the latest developments and challenges.4.Identify and provide appropriate training and professional development opportunities for educators to build their AI competencies, confidence and fluency.5.Consider the potential impact of AI on equity and accessibility and ensure that AI solutions are designed to benefit all students, regardless of their background or circumstances.6.Collaborate with external bodies, such as accrediting bodies and regulatory agencies, to align educational responses to AI across primary, secondary, and tertiary education sectors.7.Continuously monitor and evaluate the impact of AI on learning, teaching, and assessment, and be open to making necessary adjustments based on the evidence.8.Institutions prioritise assessment redesign, by adopting more authentic forms of assessment to minimise the option for
