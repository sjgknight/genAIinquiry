It is vital that we not only prepare students for this, but give them - and by extension, the nation - a competitive advantage by training the next generation of AI leaders who can both use and improve AI to build a stronger nation. Students will need a firm foundation of knowledge in how AI systems work and how they can be used, requiring that these skills be integrated within the curriculum, at all education levels. Current content on programming and coding within the Australian Curriculum, needs to be supplemented with specific AI education. Grok Academy is one example of a program already working to integrate digital and AI skills into classrooms and provides free support for Australian teachers with teaching digital"},{"id":101,"value":"While aspects of assessments will need to be managed during the emerging AI revolution, generative AI, and AI more generally, has the opportunity to enhance formative assessment. Generative AI can help to provide real-time feedback for students on a scale not otherwise practical in a classroom and may also help educators to provide more detailed and useful feedback on assessments. The Productivity Commission has found that for every four hours a schoolteacher spends teaching, they spend one hour marking (Productivity Commission 2023), while markers in higher education are often paid on piece rates that understate the time taken to mark assessments (Schneiders 14 April 2023). These tools should therefore be embraced to help educators reduce workloads and provide an enhanced educational experience for students. Support and guidance will be needed to do this, including comprehensive guidelines around how AI can be ethically and productively used to improve assessment mechanisms and assessment feedback."}],"Risks-challenges":[{"id":127,"value":"Knee-jerk bans on generative AI systems in public have the potential to produce an AI divide. If private and independent schools can teach their teachers and students how to get the most out of AI systems, while this is banned in the public system, two tiers of digital literacy will emerge. This will impact students beyond the primary and secondary school systems, putting public school graduates behind when they enter the workforce or further education. This two-tiered system will disproportionally impact those from disadvantaged backgrounds, with public students more than twice as likely to come from a disadvantaged background3, further entrenching their disadvantage. It must not be the case that only wealthy students from private schools are given the opportunity to develop AI literacy and gain the advantages that come with that."},{"id":128,"value":"The fee-for-features model of many of the most popular generative AI services, where key features or priority processing is placed behind a paywall also has the potential to exacerbate inequalities in education. Schools and higher education providers will need to explore acquiring institutional licences for these products that can enable an equality of access for their students. Alternatively, education departments or higher education providers could develop their own generative AI tools using the GPT-44 (or similar generative AI models) Application Programming Interface (API) to create a custom environment specifically designed for learning and teaching (for example, the Khanmigo AI-powered learning system). Governments may also wish to consider providing access to more sophisticated existing US models, with the addition of gateways for the purposes of auditing student behaviour, and allowing teachers to access and monitor channels."},{"id":129,"value":"The inclusion of generative AI within education systems will require rethinking of how assessments are conducted, presenting an opportunity to improve assessment practices. Educators have raised concerns that the rise of generative AI will lead to increased cheating and plagiarism and reduce the validity of assessment items. One solution is to take an archaic approach by returning assessments to supervised pen and paper examinations or oral examinations, that exclude the possibility of using AI systems. While this may be appealing and have a role in certain situations, this approach alone will likely fail to meet the needs of many students, rolling back many of the positive changes (like online learning) that have helped expand access to education, and would miss an opportunity to embrace this technological revolution. Instead, education providers should be supported to embrace and resource multiple forms of assessments for key learning outcomes, providing multiple opportunities and multiple methods of assessing studentâ€™s knowledge and abilities. Research shows that assessments that relate to authentic tasks, apply knowledge in a realistic context, and emphasise and assess a range of skills, are perceived by students to have long-term benefits and are reasonable in their demands as being positive for their learning (Struyven et al. 2006). The types of assessments to which generative AI systems may pose academic integrity risks (e.g. essays and traditional examinations) have previously received criticism for being poor measures of a studentsâ€™ knowledge and abilities (Rudolph et al. 2023). This presents an opportunity to reevaluate how Australian educational institutions at all levels can redesign assessments to allow them to not only survive in the AI age, but also work better to promote deep understanding and learning in Australian students."},{"id":130,"value":"The widespread use of generative AI, particularly around student learning and performance also raises concerns around data privacy. These concerns include privacy of the underlying data upon which AI applications are trained, but also concerns around the use of information entered into these systems, particularly for AI systems that could help to provide educators feedback on how students are faring. Data privacy more broadly will be addressed by the ongoing consultation into the safe and responsible use of AI being conducted by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, to which ATSE will be making a submission. Australian student data (such as contact details or grades) is currently stored internationally (for example via Google Classrooms), but given the nature of generative AI and emerging interaction patterns, the risk that very personal and potentially more risky data is stored about Australian students offshore is real and growing."},{"id":131,"value":"As generative AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, it will be more difficult to ensure student interactions are focused on the intended learning area. There is an emerging risk that generative AI tools are interacting conversationally with users around mental health and wellbeing. This leads to risks that students may be encouraged to talk to an AI system rather than a human. While for some students discussing mental health issues with an AI may make them more comfortable to seek help for mental health issues, some students may be less likely to access timely interventions, might receive poor advice, or mental ill health may even be exacerbated by such interactions. Systems with high levels of human intervention will still be necessary to identify students at risk and intervene swiftly and appropriately."}],"References-footnotes":[{"id":325,"value":"Bell G, Burgess J, Thomas J and Sadiq S (2023) Rapid Response Information Report: Generative AI - language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (MFMs), https://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/GenerativeAI, accessed 27 June 2023."},{"id":326,"value":"Cobbold T (2021) The Disadvantage Burden of Public Schools is Three Times That of Private Schools, https://www.acsso.org.au/application/files/9916/2314/0367/The_Disadvantage_Burden_of_Public_Schools_   is_Three_Times_That_of_Private_Schools.pdf, accessed 9 June 2023."},{"id":327,"value":"Harper R (5 June 2023) â€˜An academic governance perspective.â€™, in Tertiary Education Qualifications & Standards Agency webinar: Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Higher Education, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0f3pw2B_0, accessed 13 June 2023."},{"id":328,"value":"Jaeger C (1 February 2023) â€˜AI tool banned in Victorian state schoolsâ€™, The Age, accessed 13 June 2023, https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/ai-tool-banned-in-victorian-schools-as-implications-examined-   20230201-p5ch8h.html, accessed 13 June 2023."},{"id":329,"value":"Liu D, Ho E, Weeks R and Bridgeman A (2023) How AI can be used meaningfully by teachers and students in 2023, University of Sydney, https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/how-ai-can- be-used-meaningfully-by-teachers-and-students-in-2023/, accessed 9 June 2023."},{"id":330,"value":"Longoni C, Fradkin A, Cian L and Pennycook G (21 June 2022) â€˜News from Generative Artificial Intelligence Is Believed Lessâ€™, in ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Association for Computing Machinery, doi:10.1145/3531146.3533077."},{"id":331,"value":"Productivity Commission (2023) 5-year productivity inquiry: from learning to growth, https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/productivity/report/productivity-volume8-education-skills.pdf,   accessed 15 June 2023."},{"id":332,"value":"Rudolph J, Tan Samson and Tan Shannon (2023) â€˜ChatGPT: Bullshit spewer or the end of traditional assessments in higher education?â€™, Journal of Applied Learning & Teaching, 6(1), doi:10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.9."},{"id":333,"value":"Schneiders B (14 April 2023) â€˜Inside Australiaâ€™s university wage theft machineâ€™, The Sydney Morning Herald, accessed 15 June 2023, https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/inside-australia-s-university-"},{"id":334,"value":"wage-theft-machine-20230411-p5czn6.html, accessed 15 June 2023."},{"id":335,"value":"Struyven K, Dochy F and Janssens S (2006) â€˜Studentsâ€™ Perceptions about New Modes of Assessment in Higher Education: A Reviewâ€™, in Optimising New Modes of Assessment: In Search of Qualities and Standards, Kluwer Academic Publishers, doi:10.1007/0-306-48125-1_8."},{"id":336,"value":"Swiecki Z, Khosravi H, Chen G, Martinez-Maldonado R, Lodge JM, Milligan S, Selwyn N and GaÅ¡eviÄ‡ D (2022) â€˜Assessment in the age of artificial intelligenceâ€™, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, doi:10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100075."},{"id":337,"value":"University of Queensland (n.d.)

Failure to do so is at best an opportunity cost, and at worst misinformation that could lead to significant harms. However, the evidence base for many EdTech tools and their uses in particular contexts is not strong. A recent review of the 100 most frequently used EdTech tools in US schools found that 26/100 met any level on a formal evidence scale, where the lowest level requires just that there is some formalised background evidence synthesis that supports a theory of change for the tool use. This aligns with other evidence indicating that principles derived from research on learning are often not adhered to in app development (Meyer et al., 2021) and that in the specific context of ebook apps targeting children, app features may distract from comprehension (Furenes et al., 2021; Kucirkova, 2023). This may lead to underuse, poor use, or simply poor procurement of technologies (ITSE, 2019).

This feature of genAI is less explored, although see UTS principles below (LX at UTS, 2023)"},{"id":113,"value":"Learning processes and outcomes â€“ may be impacted by genGPT; it was this â€“ the concern that chatGPT would hamper critical thinking â€“ that underpinned New York City Department of Educationâ€™s ban on chatGPT in early 2023 (later lifted). Threshold concepts describe the key knowledge or concepts required in order to progress to a deeper level of understanding regarding a topic; once we grasp them, they change our understanding. They interact with particular methods and tools, such that sometimes new technologies mean we no longer need to learn a particular skill. For example, tools for calculating, from the abacus to the pocket calculator, through obviating understanding of manual use of log tables. It is not yet clear what impact being able to â€˜shortcutâ€™ via genAI will have, and where we should still require learning of the underlying composite skills in order to assure understanding of the higher-level skill."},{"id":114,"value":"Normative features of learning â€“ are about values, or the kinds of learning we think are important. Technologies may shift these values (Heersmink & Knight, 2018), and particular domains â€“ including the professions â€“ may make value judgements regarding the skills and knowledge it is important to â€˜haveâ€™ manually, and those we can augment with technology. Understanding both these values, and what different communities are doing is important. Aspects of this concern are addressed through analyses of employer needs and university offerings (Kitto, 2022), however the impact of genAI, and the potential for genAI to support learners in navigating professional needs, is not yet clear."},{"id":115,"value":"Human dignity and rights â€“ are expressions of fundamental values and rights, which may be impacted by genAI in a range of ways (Fergusson et al., 2023). Issues in this space include concerns regarding the right to privacy, creation and spread of misinformation, exacerbation of discrimination, impacts on intellectual property and related access to cultural heritage, and impacts on labour relations (Fergusson et al., 2023). It was this concern that appeared to underpin NSW and QLD Departments of Education from restricting chatGPT access in public schools, due to safeguarding concerns regarding potential access to explicit and harmful content (Cassidy, 2023). Understanding these issues in the particular contexts of learning environments is important for tackling them, with consideration of both the legal context â€“ as yet unclear â€“ and ethical concerns. The Electronic Privacy Information Centre (EPIC) (Fergusson et al., 2023) provide a recent overview (contextualised to US law) of genAI and fundamental rights. These risks derive from three issues: (1) harms in the nature of genAI models, their data, and use (e.g., environmental impacts); (2) harms in unintentional inappropriate use (e.g., lack of awareness regarding poor ability for certain tasks); (3) harms through intentional maleficent use (e.g., creation of misinformation). Across these, genAI has potential to foster a breakdown in trust between people, and biases in representation of people and cultures that may lead to Inquiry into the use of generative artificial intelligence in the Australian education system Submission 19 13 inequitable outcomes. It is important that learners and educators understand this context, including any legal obligations. Three particular areas of concern are: Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Information manipulation and representation."},{"id":116,"value":"Challenge: Misalignment of professional needs â€“ that education institutions, professional bodies, and professional practice become misaligned in terms of how genAI is used and what is taught, in ways that hamper professional sectors or their learning."},{"id":117,"value":"Challenge: Breakdowns in capacity â€“ that genAI may hamper human capacity, through (1) overreliance thus hampering human capacity through reduction in individual capabilities, (2) workforce restructuring that reduces human autonomy and input into decision processes, or (3) overwhelming systems through mass production of content."},{"id":118,"value":"A set of skills, including technical and social skills, will underpin the effective use of genAI; correspondingly, there is a risk that failure to cultivate this capacity in Australia, or in specific sectors, or parts of the population, will lead to harms and inequities."},{"id":119,"value":"Justice and inequitable experience of benefits and harms in genAI use: The potential of genAI to further exacerbate existing issues relating to marginalisation and poorer outcomes must be considered, alongside any potential benefits of genAI and ensuring that access to these benefits follows a justice principle; that the greatest benefits should flow to the most marginalised. Ample evidence exists that while existing technologies provide significant benefits across communities, there is inequitable exposure to harms including for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families (eSafety Commissioner, 2023a), LGBTIQ+ people (eSafety Commissioner, 2021; Johns et al., 2022), culturally and linguistically diverse communities (eSafety Commissioner, 2020; Harris & Johns, 2021), and women (eSafety Commissioner, 2022c), with negative online experiences common across communities (eSafety Commissioner, 2022a), and young people keen for support in navigating eSafety (eSafety Commissioner, 2023b).

Platform regulation, user tools and safety education designed to address these harms were regarded ambivalently by some young people in the study who spoke of the importance of social media in providing forums for community building and connection, while acknowledging that platform algorithms and business models also promote and exacerbate hate speech and harm (Johns et al., 2022, p. 30)."},{"id":121,"value":"Justice and inequities in access to opportunities to learn with and about genAI: Digital divides are comprised of inequities in affordability of devices and connectivity, accessibility across learners with diverse needs, and the abilities to engage effectively with these tools as both educators and learners. Australia has a significant digital divide, associated particularly with income and regional and remote location, and their intersection (Ingrid, 2020). Compounding concerns regarding exacerbation of digital divides is the challenge that those in regional and remote communities may have less access to professional learning opportunities, impacting capacity to support learning in schools."},{"id":122,"value":"Accessibility and learning support: GenAI may also afford opportunities for supporting accessibility of materials, helping learners with disabilities (Marino et al., 2023). Potential uses include checking for structure and clarity of definitions, visual accessibility and genAI-automated modifications for different kinds of visual needs (e.g. variations in colour perception), video captioning, etc. (McMurtrie, 2023; Young & Maher, forthcoming). However, there is also potential for these tools to have different impacts on disabled students (Guo et al., 2020), for example through impacts on learning processes, and different intersections with existing learning needs, neither of which are currently well understood. Outside of formal learning contexts, there are also concerns that tools provided to support people may also expose that data inappropriately, for example in hiring processes that provide accessibility options, but without making it clear if that data will be visible to the hiring organisation (Wall & Schellmann, 2021). This concern of justice could exacerbate existing negative online experiences of people with intellectual disability (eSafety Commissioner, 2022b). Moreover, although there are some potentials in this space, caution must be taken that genAI does not substitute for appropriate resourcing to fulfil statutory obligations, particularly where the worth of the tools is not well established with respect to efficacy."},{"id":123,"value":"Australian values: In the context of genAI itâ€™s also important to consider the particular values and context of Australia, which may not be well represented in the underlying data on which generative AI is trained, nor respect fundamental concerns of justice in Australia. While Nature has set out principles of genAI use in scholarship, as has COPE, they focus on authorship issues (Nature, 2023) rather than broader issues of justice in research. Uses of generative AI should not result in any diluting of information regarding Australia and our commitments and challenges. For example, there should be protections for Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP). â€œThose who could be exploited by AI should be shaping its projectsâ€ (Kalluri, 2020)."}],"References-footnotes":[{"id":229,"value":"AAIN.

Attention to future possibilities - based on past and present needs â€“ has the potential to address the systemic risks and opportunities which the education sector currently faces at a time of unprecedented uncertainty."},{"id":104,"value":"Recommendation 2: There needs to be meaningful, participatory and collective approaches to address the complexity of AI in education policy making Involving a diverse range of community members and education stakeholders at all stages of policy development and implementation will help to anticipate risks, build trust and co-create principles to inform complex decision-making measures. This is particularly important in anticipatory policymaking which must be responsive to local, regional, and national needs. This genuinely multi-scalar and multi-stakeholder approach throughout the entire process will lead to more timely decisions in the future. Part of this will require distributing socio-technical expertise and embedding opportunities for collective learning, experimentation, and policymaking about the development and use of AI and emerging technologies in education. In particular, there is a need to distribute expertise and embed these opportunities in a way that is accessible to and involves those from underrepresented backgrounds who might otherwise lack the opportunity and resources to participate in policy co-creation processes. To ensure that this collaborative work (which is systemic, collective, and cross-sectoral) becomes embedded across research, policy, and practice - there is a need for long-term government funding to sustain this initiative."},{"id":105,"value":"Recommendation 3: Establish a cross-sector representative body and knowledgesharing hub which embeds a research-policy-practice approach toward the governance of AI across all Australian education contexts. All areas of education are already and likely to be impacted by the use of AI and all stakeholders need opportunities to shape the implementation of AI in Australian education systems. A representative cross-sector independent body should include members from government, departmental agencies (e.g. Department of Education, Department of Industry, Science and Resources), regulatory bodies relating to education (e.g. TEQSA, ASQA and ACECQA), higher education (both STEM and HASS disciplines), schooling and early childhood sectors (including diverse range of students for all sectors), the education technology industry, teacher associations and parent groups. The body should be established to: (1) oversee the development of AI in Australian education with a focus on the risks and possibilities of open A.I. development; (2) produce regular issue-specific publications and events for the groups it represents; and, (3) maintain a set of iteratively revised guidelines and learning resources for the field."}]},{"id":21,"order":"21.00000000000000000000","submission_number":"21","Submitter":"The Australian Council of TESOL Associations","Type of org":{"id":977281,"value":"Peak body","color":"green"},"Notes":"","Recommendations":[{"id":427,"value":"Access: It is important to ensure access to generative Al amongst EAL/0 communities.

The onus should be on EdTech developers to make this information intelligible â€¢ a requirement for humans to remain accountable for all AI-assisted decision making. That is, AI can provide input and information and even recommendations, but decision making and accountability can not be delegated to a non-human and recommendations must be able to be over-ridden by a human â€¢ an absolute requirement to respect and protect student and staff privacy, with clear legal requirements for appropriate data handling, storage and disposal to be applied in all models and uses. This requirement should be crafted in such a way as to also provide protection against surveillance usage â€¢ intellectual property considerations, particularly as they relate to sensitive research data and proposals as well as assessment design â€¢ the need for developers to ensure that they are mindful of, and seek to eliminate, bias and discrimination through the data the model is trained on, the design of the model and its suggested applications â€¢ a requirement for educational administrators and institutions to ensure models and their applications are evaluated for bias and that their use is governed by institutional policies, and that adherence is monitored. As a final point, TEQSA notes that consideration should be given the data on which AI is trained to ensure local contexts are adequately represented. This is important to avoid erasing Australian and indigenous culture in a sea of US-centric internet content.

Through a combination of automation and teacher reflection, these tools can help educators provide regular and personalised feedback to help students improve their understanding and performance. By utilising machine learning, AI tools are capable of acting as tutors for individual students, by identifying concepts that require further explanation or refreshing, and offering different ways of presenting the information to the student to support learning. Of particular relevance to the school sector, AI can help present the analysis in appropriate ways to different audiences â€“ such as crafting separate summaries for teachers, parents, and students. Such capability would increase the capacity for students to receive immediate and targeted support from both teachers and parents as soon as any concerns arise"},{"id":109,"value":"Reducing administrative burden for educators Educators can leverage AI for support in designing lesson plans, creating exemplars of course material, providing feedback on assessment tasks, identifying concepts that individuals or groups of students are struggling to master, and analysing performance of students.

Such â€˜systems levelâ€™ requirements can benefit from the application of generative AI tools to streamline data analysis and presentation. AI can also contribute to more effective allocation of resources, whether they are human, physical, or electronic. By leveraging data and analytics, educational institutions can optimise their resource distribution, and potentially move to a shared-infrastructure model, ensuring resources are utilised efficiently and effectively. In the school sector, this may minimise disruptions caused by teacher absences or discipline-specific shortages. Generative AI tools also have the potential to facilitate more effective and targeted regulation in education. By analysing vast amounts of data, these tools can identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement, enabling policymakers and administrators to make evidence-based decisions to enhance the overall quality of education."},{"id":111,"value":"Mitigating disadvantage Of relevance to the school sector, generative AI tools could provide additional support to disadvantaged cohorts as an â€œAI butler or buddyâ€. Acting as a career counsellor, the AI buddy conducts conversations that individuals without social capital often miss out on. For example, these tools can help students understand potential career paths based on their interests and capabilities, as well as the study paths required to pursue those careers, and associated admissions processes. This support bridges the gap in access to valuable information and guidance, empowering disadvantaged students to make informed decisions about their futures. Generative AI tools could be used to develop augmented reality experiences, which could be particularly beneficial for remote and low socioeconomic status (SES) schools. Virtual field trips could be facilitated, offering students immersive learning opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible. Given historical challenges with equitable resource allocation, especially with emerging technologies, it would be essential to ensure that those schools most in need receive both the technology and the necessary infrastructure and teacher training to make best use of it."},{"id":112,"value":"there is tremendous scope for AI to benefit the educational journey of students and families experiencing disadvantage, and to create efficiencies for institutions in delivering tailored services. By leveraging the concept of social capital, AI can provide invaluable support to students from disadvantaged backgrounds through the provision of an AI buddy or butler. These AI companions can answer their questions and provide guidance and support, offering personalised assistance that helps level the playing field. AI can contribute to better cataloguing and linkages for lifelong learning. Through intelligent algorithms and appropriate data input, individuals can access a vast array of resources, courses, and knowledge, tailored to their specific needs and interests, enabling continuous learning throughout their lives. A significant potential benefit of AI in education is the provision of tailored, instant support that is not constrained by geographical limitations or fixed timetables. Students can receive personalised assistance and guidance whenever they need it, enhancing their learning experience. However, targeted AI interventions that â€œspeed upâ€ or â€œslow downâ€ content delivery based on student achievement could inadvertently widen achievement gaps.

Some courses, particularly in tertiary education and specific disciplines, may quickly become outdated and require regular review and updates. This will only be enabled through the development of more agile systems of governance that are capable of being more responsive to changing context while upholding the integrity of the qualification. It is critical that the process of course design and review engages carefully setting the learning objectives, to ensure they are contemporary and appropriate in the age of AI, and will produce graduates with both discipline-expertise and the ability to use technology effectively and ethically."},{"id":133,"value":"The emergence of AI tools capable of completing a substantial portion of traditional assessment tasks necessitates a re-evaluation of the purposes of assessment. While AI presents the opportunity to assess students on higher order cognitive skills, it is important to recognise that foundational content knowledge will continue to hold significance, especially in certain disciplines. It is crucial that the education sector develops new methods of assessment that can ensure learning outcomes in an age of AI tools to prevent an uncoupling of learning and assessment, which could have far-reaching consequences."},{"id":134,"value":"The student/AI hybrid model also presents potential challenges for teachers, as they may need to assess the extent to which a student has modified the output of AI-generated work. This could increase the workload for teachers and require additional evaluation measures. While generative AI tools have the potential to revolutionize teaching and assessment practices, careful consideration of the purpose of education, the role of educators, and the evolving landscape of knowledge will be critical in harnessing the benefits of AI in a way that is inclusive and mitigates potential negative consequences. To effectively navigate an AIdependent environment, ongoing professional development will be essential for teachers, school support staff, administrative personnel, and policymakers."},{"id":135,"value":"The increasing sophistication of AI poses diverse risks to research integrity, and TEQSA is engaging with the higher education sector to ensure that these risks are being recognised and reflected in updated institutional policy frameworks and the associated practices. AI has the capability to generate not just fake data, including false or doctored images, but entirely manufactured studies and journal articles. Images generated by AI are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and can compromise the integrity of research findings."},{"id":136,"value":"Additionally, the administrative burden of the scientific peer-review process may result in reviewers outsourcing the review to AI systems to either provider the reviewer with a summary or provide feedback. AI systems do not hold the same level of detailed expertise of a human discipline expert, which may result in fewer erroneous or misleading research findings being identified prior to publication. Decreasing genuine engagement by experts with novel research in their field also presents a risk to innovation and collaboration"},{"id":137,"value":"There are significant risks to intellectual property where sensitive pre-published research findings, doctoral theses presented for examination or grant applications are uploaded to a third-party platform, and TEQSA is working with institutions to ensure they are proactively managing these risks through their policies and contracts."},{"id":138,"value":"It not appropriately managed, AI has the potential to dilute the quality of published research, obscure genuine research in a sea of AI-generated content and ultimately undermine the publicâ€™s trust in the scientific process."},{"id":139,"value":"The current crop of large language models can produce many of the artefacts that institutions have historically relied on for that assurance of learning, such as essays, coding tasks and both worded and numerical maths problems. As a result, without a transformation in how institutions assess student achievement of learning outcomes, there is a risk to the integrity of the system. While some commentators have welcomed the fact that AI can replace lower-level tasks that require content recall and allow for assessment of higher order cognition, there are several fundamental principles to consider. â€¢ The accuracy of current language models is not reliable, and their output needs to be scrutinised for errors. If the education system were to shift entirely to a â€œStudent/AI hybridâ€ model, it raises concerns about how future students will acquire the necessary content knowledge to effectively evaluate AI-generated output. â€¢ Completion of tasks such as essays holds pedagogical value that is unrelated to assessment purposes. For example, through writing essays, students learn to research, structure and defend arguments, and communicate their ideas in a written form. Motivating students to engage in these tasks may become challenging without the incentive of assessmentbased evaluation. Assessing the process of creating the artefact while employing the use of AI tools can provide an effective assessment process, but requires a greater investment of academic time in the marking process. These opportunities and impacts need to be recognised and appropriately resourced by institutions. â€¢ The use of AI in education raises serious concerns about data sovereignty and privacy. It is essential to address these issues and ensure that the use of AI tools does not compromise student, staff or institutional data and intellectual property. â€¢ Humanity will continue to require future generations of creative thinkers with discipline expertise. Because generative AI is trained on data, and all data is by definition historical, an over-reliance on AI may limit innovation, insight, and discovery. It is therefore crucial that society scaffolds in the introduction of AI tools through a studentâ€™s education journey, to ensure all students develop critical thinking skills and to defend the pipeline of students who can reach expert levels. â€¢ There is a risk of AI systems becoming self-contained and self-referential. An illustrative example is an educator using AI to write the lesson plans, design the assessment task and marking rubric. The student then uses AI to produce the assessment tasks, and the educator then uses AI to grade the assessment and provide feedback. In such a situation, the limited human involvement in the process undermines not just the educational experience but the very process of learning. Ultimately, AI is necessitating a rethink of how institutions of higher education can assure themselves that students have met the learning outcomes of a degree when the artefacts that have historically been relied on in current forms of assessment can be completed to a passing level with minimal student engagement."},{"id":140,"value":"Current large language models are reflective of the enormous data sets they are trained on, resulting in a reflection of the biases and discrimination already present in those data sets. AI also has the potential to reinforce bias and disadvantage when algorithms are misused or poorly designed.

The onus should be on EdTech developers to make this information intelligible â€¢ a requirement for humans to remain accountable for all AI-assisted decision making. That is, AI can provide input and information and even recommendations, but decision making and accountability can not be delegated to a non-human and recommendations must be able to be over-ridden by a human â€¢ an absolute requirement to respect and protect student and staff privacy, with clear legal requirements for appropriate data handling, storage and disposal to be applied in all models and uses. This requirement should be crafted in such a way as to also provide protection against surveillance usage â€¢ intellectual property considerations, particularly as they relate to sensitive research data and proposals as well as assessment design â€¢ the need for developers to ensure that they are mindful of, and seek to eliminate, bias and discrimination through the data the model is trained on, the design of the model and its suggested applications â€¢ a requirement for educational administrators and institutions to ensure models and their applications are evaluated for bias and that their use is governed by institutional policies, and that adherence is monitored. As a final point, TEQSA notes that consideration should be given the data on which AI is trained to ensure local contexts are adequately represented. This is important to avoid erasing Australian and indigenous culture in a sea of US-centric internet content.

This frees up educatorsâ€™ time so that they can spend it on the aspects of their roles where the human value-add is more critical, such as student consultations, class time and personalised feedback."}],"Risks-challenges":[{"id":85,"value":"In teaching: â€¢  Ensuring the safe use of Gen-AI by students and educators.â€¢  Raising levels of awareness and understanding among teachers and students about the strengths, limitations and risks of Gen-AI.â€¢  Overcoming perceptions that we can out-design or out-run Gen-AI by designing creative or authentic assessments that are â€˜AI-proofâ€™.â€¢  Ensuring staff and students understand what biases in Gen-AI training data can mean for information discovery, analysis and conclusion-drawing.â€¢  Ensuring students do not develop an over-reliance on Gen-AI, nor a fear of the technology or reluctance to learn about it and engage with it.â€¢  Preventing the inappropriate use of Gen-AI in assessments.â€¢  Building studentsâ€™ ability to separate human from AI content.â€¢  Reliance, at any level, on currently available AI detection software, which are inherently flawed."},{"id":86,"value":"In research: â€¢  Privacy breaches of study participantsâ€™ personally identifiable information, through release of this information to Gen-AI tools, or the release of de-identified data in a way that allows for reidentification.â€¢  Privacy breaches of researchers/collaboratorsâ€™ personally identifiable information, through submission of this confidential information to Gen-AI tools.â€¢  Loss of control of Intellectual Property or Copyright, through the Gen-AI tools reproducing content without attribution.â€¢  Breaches of contractual obligations, including commercial contracts, data sharing agreements and material transfer agreements.â€¢  Non-compliance with the terms of funding agreements.â€¢  Inappropriate management of First Nations data.â€¢  Disclosure of sensitive environmental/ecological information.â€¢  Breach of research codes, Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) approvals (e.g. Australian Code for the Conduct of Responsible Research).â€¢  Breach of research funding councilsâ€™ specific policies regarding Gen-AI."},{"id":87,"value":"Other key risks for research integrity centre around lack of accountability and oversight when using Gen-AI to produce research outputs, specifically: â€¢  Inability to attribute authorship where Gen-AI has contributed content from unknown sources.â€¢  Inability to reproduce or replicate consistent results when using Gen-AI to provide content for research findings â€“ results will vary at each attempt making verification of research findings impossible.â€¢  Inability to establish and evaluate accuracy and validity of content generated by Gen-AI â€“probabilistic models that generate data may be biased, or produce â€˜hallucinationsâ€™ of inaccurate content, which can be hard to identify.â€¢  Inability to have contributory IP acknowledged by others if research outputs are incorporated into data that becomes available to the Gen-AI model, and is used elsewhere. No guarantee that licences on open data, code or images are applied (e.g. Creative Commons).â€¢  Accountability and trust â€“ personal accountability by individual researchers underpins all research.

In order to ensure that students are graduating with the skills and knowledge appropriate to their program of study academic staff must devise assessments that can accurately ascertain whether or not the student has attained the relevant skills and knowledge (and to what level). This is considered a minimum requirement under TEQSAâ€™s Higher Education Standards Framework.1 There is a risk that generative AI will make this more difficult when such AIs are able to produce outputs that the student is then assessed on. For example, students can already produce short form pieces of prose using current generative AI technologies. There is a risk in this environment that over time universities may reach a point where they can no longer assure the required learning has occurred in what they claim to be teaching."},{"id":103,"value":"teaching staff will need to continuously develop new methods of assessment that assess students at a level beyond the levels of AIs. This entails a significant ongoing workload increase, as teaching staff will now be required to continuously re-tool assessments and workloads. Further, the amount of work needed to complete a degree may need to be increased, or devised differently, in an environment where students are using AIs. Put simply, the use of AIs in teaching and learning is highly likely to drive pedagogical change."},{"id":104,"value":"Ideally, students should be assessed on their capacity to critically interrogate the outputs of AIs and the learning process itself, rather than the artefacts they produce that are currently taken to be evidence that learning has occurred. This is a significant paradigm shift for teaching institutions. This type of assessment will likely require more one on one student-staff interaction to ensure that skills and knowledge have truly been attained and work completed. This will be more demanding on staff and may mean that current expectations around how many students one staff member can teach need to be completely re-se"},{"id":105,"value":"The use of AI in research also presents risks around academic integrity. While institutions will be looking to manage instances of deliberate manipulation/falsification/misrepresentation and accidental or unintended corruption of data, there is a real risk that AI applications will be considerably ahead of current research integrity processes that would detect problems or irregularities. It may be that problematic research is not detected for some time, if at all, by which time there could be widespread ramifications."},{"id":106,"value":"AI systems currently use limited sets of data that can be prone to biases based on data selection â€“ something that is opaque to staff and students. AIs can also replicate and reinforce existing social biases that are present inside of data sets, for example the underrepresentation of certain groups in certain academic fields. This is because inherent in the creation of AI is that any pre-existing bias or discrimination that is either unconsciously, or consciously, imbedded will set the â€˜learningâ€™ pattern for that AI"},{"id":107,"value":"THE RISK OF MISGUIDED TECHNOLOGICAL REDUNDANCIES There are a wide variety of tasks currently performed by staff in the academic context that institutions may look to AIs to perform partially or fully in the future.The NTEUâ€™s position is that AI is not an appropriate replacement for staff because it does not engage in critical thinking, produce genuine creativity or innovation. AI is also absent of the capacity to consider ethical component of its output â€“ it is simply using a pre-programmed ethical framework which may be structurally or systemically biased. Human staff are required to monitor and accept or reject AI outputs as appropriate."},{"id":108,"value":"There are also concerns on how AI may impact on privacy and the security of personal data (including the use of student and staff personal data â€“ for example, unauthorised access of data, through to institutional managements using AI to mine confidential data or information in workplace relations situations)."},{"id":109,"value":"Another concern is around the usage of third-party AIs and the need for this to be disclosed to staff and students. Most advanced AIs are being developed for foreign, for-profit entities, and there is little transparency about what types of data they collect about users and how they use this. With higher education institutions â€“ both public and private â€“ routinely engaging in external contractors for the delivery of teaching, student support (both academic and welfare) as well as with the administration and technical tasks, there is already little (if any) transparency around these arrangements. The use of external AI driven platforms and services by third parties to the education providers adds further complexity and increases the potential risk of adverse consequences for staff and students."}],"References-footnotes":[{"id":228,"value":"As complied in UNESCO, ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education, 2023, https://www.iesalc.unesco.org/wpcontent/ uploads/2023/04/ChatGPT-and-Artificial-Intelligence-in-higher-education-Quick-Start-guide_EN_FINAL.pdf"}],"Processed":true,"Recco_tags":[{"ids":{"database_table_183319":151,"database_table_184385":1},"value":{"id":980196,"value":"PD","color":"light-red"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":149,"database_table_184385":4},"value":{"id":980183,"value":"local-responses-and-autonomy","color":"dark-cyan"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":147,"database_table_184385":8},"value":{"id":980188,"value":"new-workforce-model","color":"light-brown"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":148,"database_table_184385":8},"value":{"id":980188,"value":"new-workforce-model","color":"light-brown"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":150,"database_table_184385":10},"value":{"id":980190,"value":"curricula-changes","color":"light-green"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":152,"database_table_184385":11},"value":{"id":980191,"value":"new-policy","color":"dark-purple"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":147,"database_table_184385":17},"value":{"id":980195,"value":"resourcing","color":"dark-cyan"}}],"Lookup":[{"id":147,"value":"Staff will however need institutional support and resources to achieve this, including greater workload allocations for course design and student assessment and frameworks for considering what types of AI usage might constitute plagiarism.

It can provide personalised instruction and learning efficiencies; explain concepts in more than one way and in varying detail; and aid just-in-time learning anywhere, anytime"},{"id":63,"value":"Learning to code and program The use of generative AI may be particularly useful as a tool for learning to code and program â€“ and this is already being incorporated into practice in these professions. The Technologies Curriculum that has been implemented since 2016 required many teachers to undertake professional learning in this field and requires students to learn to program in multiple languages by the end of Year 8. Generative AI could be an effective tool to support primary and secondary teachers in their classroom practice."},{"id":66,"value":"Digital and data literacy Generative AI tools (such as Chat GPT or Midjourney) are effective examples to be able to teach data science and computer science concepts and tools such as large language models (LLMs). They are also useful to demonstrate the different meanings of terms, such as risk, and predictions that are used in different ways in different disciplines."},{"id":67,"value":"Support for teaching As in many other fields, there is potential for generative AI tools to do some of the more routine work of educators. This could be for design or planning (such as platforms to create a first draft of a unit design or lesson plan), teaching (through personalised learning models that allow just-in-time interactions with students and the provision of feedback) or assessment (although privacy should be considered)."}],"Risks-challenges":[{"id":76,"value":"Learning practices There is substantial pedagogical value to be found in the significant risk taking involved in learning without generative AI: learners often feel uncertain about a learning situation and it is precisely by overcoming this challenge that they engage and learn. The reliance on generative AI has the potential to reduce opportunities for critical thinking and problemsolving, creativity; it may promote laziness and lack of independent thought; and it may limit the development of deep knowledge. Students may lack the confidence to engage in that first step and take the essential risk on not knowing in order to further understand a topic. In addition, AI responses can be deceptively convincing, leading to an assumption that the response generated is accurate. This therefore required a deliberative approach to learning design to ensure that independent thought, critical thinking and creativity are central to the learning experience"},{"id":77,"value":"Assessment design Changes as a reaction to academic integrity considerations will most probably result in the need for substantial assessment and task redesign. Education systems and individual institutions and processes will need to budget for the time it will take practitioners to do this work. Some of the models of assessment commonly used (for example multiple choice questions) have been adopted because educators need to be able to implement the assessment, generate marks, and provide feedback at scale and in a reasonable timeframe. If generative AI could be used to achieve different types of marking at scale then this provides us with an opportunity to consider other approaches to assessment that may better represent student learning. A risk and challenge in relation to this is that education systems including universities can be slow to change. The policies developed need to be flexible enough to adapt as the technology changes."},{"id":78,"value":"Academic Integrity The immediate reaction by education institutions and sectors has been in relation to academic integrity. This is appropriate, however it should be noted that any tools that claim to be able to automatically detect the use of generative AI in the creation of assessment submissions (e.g. text, images, videos) will need to be continually updated as the tools and accuracy of the underlying model(s) continue to improve. In addition to tools, education policies need to be developed in relation to the acceptable use of generative AI in assessment. Some regulations can be a good thing â€“ even if itâ€™s only to help people understand how to be safe â€“ because people are not always sure what they are and are not allowed to do. Yet, these regulations will need to be dynamic to some extent and be continuously adapted to changing contexts. The use of AI tools can present a risk to academic integrity, similar to contract cheating and other more traditional forms of cheating that some learners may engage in. Educating students in the use of AI, in how it works and in understanding its impact in terms of their learning and integrity is the key way forward. Educators must design assessment that minimises the risk of AI tools supplanting the learner, to ensure that the learner can demonstrate mastery of the learning outcomes. The growth in detection tools is unlikely to completely ensure integrity while introducing risks to the student experience, for example, the risk of false positives that have the potential for serious detrimental impact"},{"id":79,"value":"Ethical data practices There are risks associated with the data that the large language models are using. Whether this data has been acquired ethically is still being challenged, with implications for multiple considerations including privacy, copyright, structural bias, data integrity and cultural safety. Also, using data and models owned by multinationals for education and then giving our studentsâ€™ data to them entails inherent risk. Students should be asked for their consent to share their documents with generative AI. In many journals, they do not allow reviews to be written by generative AI because they do not have the permission of the authors to do that. Ethics and integrity go hand in hand, but teaching students the ethical use of AI will require more than teaching them about academic integrity. Understanding the ethics would involve considering privacy, copyright, bias, misrepresentation and deception. Perhaps the use of AI tools is more about the ethics and understanding the risks than it is about technology."},{"id":80,"value":"Models built on representative data Education needs to ensure that generative AI tools and models that are accessed are built using data that is representative and diverse. For the most part, large language models are built on data that is from English-speaking countries. There needs to be consideration of other languages, the impact that this has on ways of thinking and framing questions. Consideration particularly needs to be given to Indigenous languages and ways of knowing, the privacy of this data, the impact on the responses generated and the potential for assessment and teaching practices to further minimise the experiences and ways of knowing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These models are also largely built using data generated from contributions to text available on the internet. This does preference the ways of writing and the opinions of mostly white, male, middle and upper class professionals. Education needs to advocate to ensure that children, students and families experiencing disadvantage have a voice and that their experiences are included in the way that generative AI produces responses"},{"id":81,"value":"Access to generative AI tools Education needs to ensure that the gap that already exists for children, students and families experiencing disadvantage in terms of access to technology does not grow further through the growth and spread of generative AI. There are challenges in terms of access to technology, to reliable internet, and access to data. Any education that builds on the use of generative AI needs to consider support for students who cannot continue the connection with the technology when they leave the schoolhouse. This is particularly relevant considering the nation-wide bans on the use of mobile phones in schools. These bans have significant implications for students experiencing disadvantage to be able to seamlessly transition their learning with technology in and out of school"},{"id":82,"value":"Tools and platforms for the use of generative AI Education also needs to consider the implications of age restrictions on access to generative AI tools, with most primary school students being too young to consent to using the tools."}],"References-footnotes":[],"Processed":true,"Recco_tags":[{"ids":{"database_table_183319":86,"database_table_184385":12},"value":{"id":980192,"value":"research-investment","color":"orange"}},{"ids":{"database_table_183319":86,"database_table_184385":21},"value":{"id":980197,"value":"evidence-generation","color":"brown"}}],"Lookup":[{"id":86,"value":"Evidence informed decision making We want to encourage innovative, safe practice for the use of generative AI in education.

It cannot replace the indispensable role of human interaction and cooperation, which must remain at the heart of education in Australia.\n24.\tThe 2023 UNESCO publication, Generative AI and the future of education, emphasised the need to â€˜be watchful against the potentials of newly powerful generative AI technology, alongside older digital tools and services, to undermine the authority and status of teachers â€¦â€™. It further noted that while â€˜frontier technologyâ€™ might be part of the answer to particular challenges in education, ultimately â€˜well-run schools, enough teachers, and teachers with the requisite conditions, training and salaries that allow them to be successful remain the main ingredients of a sustainable remedyâ€™.17"},{"id":142,"value":"25.\tThe right to privacy is a cornerstone human right18 and its importance â€˜in an increasingly data-centric world is growingâ€™,19 because generative AI tools may not only facilitate privacy intrusions, but deepen those intrusions in new and concerning ways.20 Generative AI tools rely on both large data sets to train the technology and the collection of personal data to optimize the individual user experience. This creates a range of privacy risks, particularly given the increased prevalence of cyberattacks and data breaches. The Commission has highlighted these issues in a number of submissions made this year.21 These concerns are particularly relevant in the context of using generative AI tools in the education system, where many of the users will be children who will have no real option but to use the technology if it is adopted by their schools.\n26.\tThere is an urgent need to ensure that generative AI tools are only adopted where concerns related to data privacy, security and consent are being considered and actively addressed.\n27.\tThe Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department is conducting a review of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), having closed submissions to their Review Report in April 2023. Several proposals in the Review Report considered strengthening privacy protections for children and in respect of AI. It is likely that outcomes from the Review Report will directly impact privacy, security and data protection for children and certain AI tools.\n28.\tThere must be clear guidelines established to expressly protect student data, limit access to sensitive information, and ensure that robust privacy and security measures are in place. Standards should be established to govern the collect, storage and use of personal information in the context of generative AI tools in education."},{"id":143,"value":"29.\tA related risk that requires urgent attention is the potential commercialisation of student data obtained from the use of generative AI tools.\n \n\n\nAustralian Human Rights Commission\nUtilising Ethical AI in the Australian Education System, 14 July 2023\n\n\n30.\tPractices such as the sale or transfer of childrenâ€™s personal data to third parties should be banned, or heavily restricted, to protect childrenâ€™s rights. For example, among other things, General Comment 25 requires parties to:\n[P]rohibit by law the profiling or targeting of children of any age for commercial purposes on the basis of a digital record of their actual or inferred characteristics, including group or collective data, targeting by association or affinity profiling.\nPractices that rely on neuromarketing, emotional analytics, immersive advertising and advertising in virtual and augmented reality environments to promote products, applications and services should also be prohibited from engagement directly or indirectly with children.22\n31.\tOne example is the use of student search queries being analysed to inform targeted advertising. Another is for student data obtained via educational AI applications to be on-sold to third parties.23\n32.\tIn 2021 the National Childrenâ€™s Commissioner warned that by a childâ€™s 13th birthday advertisers will have gathered on average more than 72 million data points about them.24 It is essential that the data collected through the use of educational technology at schools should not be used for other purposes, and that children are protected from data surveillance."},{"id":144,"value":"33.\tGenerative AI tools are trained on large datasets and generate predictive outputs based on algorithms. It is widely recognised that â€˜algorithms are not neutral, they are developed using metadata that exclude information on marginalized groups and are therefore unrepresentative or biasedâ€™.25\n34.\tThis means that generative AI tools can generate output that is biased, and potentially perpetuate unfairness or even result in unlawful discrimination.26 The risks of bias and discrimination are highlighted in the AI Discussion Paper27 and were examined in detail by the Commission in the Final Report and the Technical Paper, Using artificial intelligence to make decisions: Addressing the problem of algorithmic bias. It is essential to ensure that this issue is addressed so that Australiaâ€™s education system is fair, inclusive and promotes equal opportunities for all students."},{"id":145,"value":"35.\tThe AI Discussion Paper highlighted the creation of misinformation and disinformation as one of the key challenges posed by the increased application of AI.28 The Rapid Response Information Report commissioned by Australiaâ€™s National Science and Technology Council similarly identified both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (MFMs) as having â€˜the potential for misuse by generating high-quality, cheap and personalised content, including for harmful purposesâ€™, with the use of generative AI tools to generate deep fakes.29\n36.\tThe use of generative AI tools in educational settings necessarily raises ethical considerations in terms of their potential use to create fake or manipulated content, such as â€˜deepfakesâ€™.30"},{"id":146,"value":"37.\tIn isolation, these reforms are insufficient. There is also a need for digital literacy education and training to ensure that users are able to identify fake or manipulated content, and establish that users understand the importance of engaging with the technology in responsible and ethical ways. The importance of promoting digital literacy is discussed further below."},{"id":147,"value":"38.\tThe ease with which essays, research papers or creative works can be produced using generative AI tools creates risks of plagiarism or intellectual dishonesty. The\n \n\n\nAustralian Human Rights Commission\nUtilising Ethical AI in the Australian Education System, 14 July 2023\n\n\nrelease of ChatGPT in November last year immediately gave rise to concerns â€˜that\na tsunami of cheating was on the horizonâ€™.31\n39.\tBoth around the world, and in Australia, many schools and universities responded by initially banning these technologies from their devices and networks. The New York City public school district became one of the first to temporarily ban ChatGPT from its schoolsâ€™ devices and networks in January 2023, although this ban was reversed several months later.32 Many schools and universities in Australia have also introduced bans or restrictions on the use of generative AI tools at various points, including initial bans by the public school systems in all Australian states other than South Australia.33\n40.\tThere is now growing recognition that an absolute ban on this technology is likely unworkable and disadvantageous for students.34 In particular any ban that is not consistently applied across the Australian education system will create a digital divide between those who have been taught to use generative AI tools at school, and those who have not.35 It also forgoes an important opportunity to teach students how to responsibly use new technologies that are becoming increasingly important, and to develop necessary skills for the future.\n41.\tInstead we should aim to encourage the responsible and ethical use of generative AI tools by students, rather than simply banning them. Students should be educated about the importance of academic integrity, and clear guidelines should be established on the appropriate use of AI-generated content, citation practices, and the need for originality in student work.\n42.\tTo ensure academic integrity, there must be greater research, development and deployment of digital tools capable of identifying AI-generated content. One example is the development of Checker AI which uses its own AI models to predict if text has been written by a human, and to verify the authenticity of student work. This demonstrates the duality of AI tools being both a cause, and solution, to challenges in Australiaâ€™s education system."},{"id":148,"value":"49.\tWhile generative AI has the potential to improve educational outcomes, it is critical to address the digital divide and ensure that equitable opportunities are created for all students, regardless of their background.\n50.\tThe 2021 Australian Digital Inclusion Index shows that there remains a substantial digital divide in Australia.36 One in four people in Australia were identified as being â€˜digitally excludedâ€™ and â€˜people with low levels or income, education and\n \n\n\nAustralian Human Rights Commission\nUtilising Ethical AI in the Australian Education System, 14 July 2023\n\n\nemployment, those living in some regional areas, people aged over 65 and people\nwith a disabilityâ€™ being identified as being of particular risk of being left behind.37\n51.\tStudents who are unable to access the digital tools they need for school risk missing out on crucial learning opportunities that other students take for granted, with the risk of exacerbating educational disadvantage. The Smith Family has estimated that 1 in 6 of the families they work with cannot currently access the digital tools that their children need for school.38 Research published by the Australian Education Union in 2020 revealed a â€˜persistent long-term gap in digital access, affordability and ability experienced by many public school studentsâ€™.39 Ensuring digital inclusion and equity needs to be a key principle informing the use of generative AI in the Australian education system.\n52.\tGenerative AI tools can also potentially play a significant role in helping to level the playing field for all students, regardless of their backgrounds. These tools can provide access to high-quality educational content to students from disadvantaged or low socio-economic backgrounds, and the potential for AI- powered tutors and translators to assist students with particular needs or challenges is significant.\n53.\tIn order to both improve digital equity in the use of generative AI and harness the potential benefits of generative AI tools in reducing educational disadvantage, policies that remove barriers to access, provide targeted training and capacity building, and encourage community engagement and outreach should be pursued."},{"id":149,"value":"54.\tEnsuring equitable access to technology for students is essential to help close the digital divide. This means that public schools must be resourced to allow them to provide students with access to technology, and also ensuring that digital technology is available for use in community facilities

Bias in algorithms or incorrect information is also a concern, as the outcomes produced by generative AI are only as good as the data it has been trained on.

AI tutors can be trained to support students using the Socratic style which guides students to find the answers themselves rather than providing them with direct answers to questions. AI tutors will be able to provide students with real time feedback, providing additional support and guidance in early units of a course. Further, they can adapt learning materials based on studentsâ€™ existing knowledge of the subject matter and modify these materials as the student advances through the course, focusing on learning outcomes and the attainment of job-ready skills.\n\nEducators can be expected to respond by gradually changing the nature of assessment practices, with less emphasis given to assessment tasks which prioritise a studentâ€™s ability to consolidate and recall information, and more emphasis given to assessment which guides students to solve problems, contextually analyse and synthesise information, provide personal perspectives, and demonstrate meta-cognition in their understanding of discipline knowledge."},{"id":487,"value":"In addition to [genAI adaptive tutors] being beneficial to time-poor and mature-age students upskilling while juggling full-time work, it may also be particularly beneficial to neuro-divergent learners who require different approaches to learning in order to thrive."},{"id":488,"value":"It is predicted that AI tutors may be trained to detect student engagement and wellbeing, enabling them to alert teaching staff who can support with appropriate engagement support. Gen AI tools will also enable the provision of powerfully personalised career guidance and support services â€“ everything from skills and aptitudes assessment to resume creation, interview practice, and authentic workplace simulation.\n\nThe expectations of employers and industry will be a key driver of change in course and program structure: it is foreseeable that employers will demand undergraduate candidates for entry-level employment positions possess knowledge and practical experience of industry-specific AI language models and tools. It is anticipated this expectation will compel the education sector to incorporate AI literacy and usage skills courses into curricula (and drive greater ongoing collaboration between educational institutions and industry)."},{"id":489,"value":"Gen AI tools will also assist in improving the efficacy of education administration by streamlining and standardising routine tasks such as paying fees, accessing study support, reminding students of key deadlines and due dates and relevant university policies and procedures. This is anticipated to accelerate as more Gen AI use-cases are identified and industry-specific large language models emerge and evolve in the years to come.\n\nAs usage of Gen AI progresses, it will alter the ways students learn and the ways in which educators teach. Gen AI tools are anticipated to enable educators to more efficiently manage the significant proportion of their workload currently consumed by administrative and assessment grading tasks.
