Professional Development","education ministers from all Australian states and territories have agreed that responding to the risks and harnessing opportunities from generative AI technologies is a national education priority. [...] agreed to develop the Australian Framework for Generative Artificial Intelligence in Schools, which will cover elements of human and social wellbeing, transparency, fairness, accountability and privacy and security. [...] The Inquiry should factor the work of the taskforce and the framework it has developed in making its recommendations.","While there will undoubtedly be generally accepted standards and practices across the education sector nationally and globally, many of the opportunities and risks of GenAI in education fall within existing policies and procedures of individual institutions.","The principle of institutional autonomy should be consistent with other risks in education.  The principle of institutional autonomy should be consistent with other risks in education. GenAI is new but we recommend the government response is consistent with other issues in education such as academic integrity, cyber security, etc, by setting a threshold and allowing institutions to respond in a way that best supports their own operations and communities. This does not preclude facilitated cross-sector engagement and the hosting of sector-wide working groups to discuss and prepare best practice guidelines, both for responsible use and for incorporating GenAI into existing policies and practices.","It is recommended that a responsible use approach to the incorporation of GenAI is encouraged. Beyond a desire to encourage responsible experimentation and the development of an informed and critical awareness of the benefits and risks of GenAI, an important factor in taking this position is that detection of AI-generated content is unlikely to be feasible. Emerging evidence suggests that humans are not reliable in detecting AI- generated content. Equally, AI detection tools are non-transparent and unreliable in their testing and reporting of their own accuracy, and are likely to generate an intolerably high proportion of both false positives and false negatives. The exception to detection difficulties is where watermarks are injected. Watermarks are coded patterns of output that are intentionally detectable to AI detection systems. To make this system feasible would require the regulation of all GenAI technologies to mandate the injection of watermarks into their content. Unregulated GenAI technologies would allow students to avoid this. Other GenAI technologies can be used to parse watermarked content to remove the watermark. Humans can inject watermarks into human-generated content to discredit detection technologies.","Clarity around the responsible use of GenAI in assessment is necessary to help students navigate uncertainty and to make them responsible for their own academic conduct.","Alternative approaches to assessment will be needed, in which a combination of assessment of process, closer working relationships with students, and more complex assessments will need to be developed. As a related issue, care should be taken when adapting GenAI into marking or feedback practices. Use of GenAI in assessing student work and/or providing feedback without specialist training entails a reduction in established human expertise and, potentially, a reduction in human connection and trust relations. Thus, institutions need a clear framework for making decisions about how to incorporate GenAI into these powerful practices.","We see GenAI as an opportunity for greater engagement with students in the design of learning. To facilitate AI literacies, Monash will use a Students as Partners approach, in which student representatives work directly with academics to collaboratively co-design learning and teaching approaches and assessments. There may be scope to develop generic course-level outcomes which align with Monash Graduate Attributes, in recognition of the importance to invest in teaching students about AI literacy.","In relation to academic misconduct, recognising GenAI as a collaboration tool intentionally separates it from plagiarism, collusion and contract cheating. At the same time, we need to maintain mechanisms to restrict GenAI use in assessments that require students to demonstrate human capacities. Therefore, we are exploring a â€˜restorative practiceâ€™ approach to suspected academic integrity breaches.","Institutional governance and policy positions need to consider the context of use, responsibility for errors and consider alternative definitions, or categorisation of attributes, such as â€˜authorâ€™ â€˜collaboratorâ€™ which have an inherent meaning and subject position that may not be appropriate to apply to GenAI content.\n\nIn light of the above, we are confident that managing the risks and seizing the opportunities can be accomplished within ards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2021 and our own institutional policies.","Usage guidelines, preferably consistent throughout the sector;","Clear internal use policies;","Education/professional development;","Privacy and data protection â€“ need a clear understanding of whether data is used to improve the AI and where data is stored.","â–ª  Raise awareness of generative AI's potential uses and limitations.","â–ª  Use Generative AI as a complementary tool, not a substitute for human researchers.","â–ª  Incorporate proctored, in-person assessments alongside AI tools.","â–ª  Develop ethical principles and guidelines for Generative AI in higher education.","â–ª  Promote originality and creativity in assignments.","â–ª  Implement strategies to prevent plagiarism when using Generative AI.","â–ª  Provide personalized feedback to students.","â–ª  Use formative assessment practices like self-assessment and peer feedback.","â–ª  By addressing ethical issues and limitations, educators can harness Generative AI as a valuable educational resource.","â—    that teachers, school leaders and principals be educated about the risks and opportunities presented by AI through a nationally consistent approach.","â—    That any intent to implement AI in schools be accompanied by appropriate and realistic timeframes, resourcing and training. It should not be added to existing curriculum must be explicit licensing from ACCARA to â€˜make roomâ€™ for any new content.","â—   That Principals be involved in the design of national guidelines, policy and protocol related to this issue and its implementation in schools.","Suggestion of guidelines needed","Many duties of teachers and resource developers can be separated into a special department where a limited number of persons supervise/ coordinate AI in those duties;","Higher level of centralisation of the curriculum with specific norms (not guidelines) still with a focus on modern practices of student-centered education;","To have a governing body around the use of AI technology in Education Sectors;","Compulsory curriculum around AI use for all;","Bank of approved tasks developed by AI","AI Literacy for Teachers;","Focus on ITE","I strongly recommend a significant and rapid investment in research capability to provide evidence to inform responses to the issues raised in this Inquiry.","Timely and ongoing consultation with the profession in their workplaces and through their unions is critical to establishing guidelines that protect both teachers and students, without diminishing the educative potential of AI;","A cohesive and collaborative approach to the development of AI guidelines is critical to ensure adequate school and sector-wide safeguards for teachers and students.","To monitor plagiarism, AI generators should have an indelible watermark which can be detected by tools that recognise plagiarism. In doing this though, we create an environment where educators are having to rely on tools to recognise plagiarism, tools are not reliable. Clearly, other ways of assessing the validity of student work is needed","National policy around the use of plagiarism detectors is important as well to prevent the damage that comes from the hyper-surveillance of student performance, potentially by plagiarism detectors that will continue to have a fail rate.","There needs to be clear policy and cross-sectoral agreement around student access to AI tools that is consistent and not determined or restricted by cost or differing licenses and agreements.","Consistent and Effective National and Cross-Sectoral Policy on AI: Policy, at scale, to ensure ongoing transparent, ethical access to AI in education is critical so that the access to AI tools is fair and equitable and does not perpetuate disadvantage. It is also known that AI can reinforce bias that can disadvantage learners. Policy should clearly stipulate the ongoing responsibility that creators have in ensuring that the AI tools they create meet the high standards required in learning environments to keep students safe and mitigate additional responsibility being expected of teachers to ensure the tools they are using in the classroom are effective, pedagogically sound and will not perpetuate bias.","Ensuring we know how these tools are working and coming up with the decisions they make is important.AI tools are pedagogical agents that will be drawing on what they may recognise as weaknesses and strengths of students and will change the way they support students accordingly. Whilst this sounds highly effective and appropriate pedagogy, this will require data capture that we, as teachers, may not see or know is happening.","Knowing where this data is stored and communicated is also important. English teachers need to understand the implications of using such tools and the problematic nature of any data capture of our students that may remove student agency in their life- long learning process and what it may do with data like facial recognition or other bodily data captures that can be used to determine how each individual may be perceived by the AI tool and how it may attribute bias potentially limiting the life choices of the students it â€˜teachesâ€™.\nWhile this issue is clearly one for education sectors and schools, campaigns to support parent and student understanding of the risk to student data and how parents, students and teachers can keep them safe is important. Adequate and timely professional learning for teachers is critical so they are aware of the affordances of the system and how to ensure the protection of student data.","There needs to be adequate and ongoing upskilling to support student digital citizenship so young people understand the risk to their data and teachers also understand their role in protecting student data. Students need to be provided with adequate understanding to make good decisions online that means they are not accessing apps or other sites where their data is potentially not secure or could be misused. More government policy and guidance are needed in this area.","The Cross Curriculum Priorities in the present ACARA syllabuses can be expanded to include â€˜Ethical use of Technologyâ€™ as a key area across all subjects with explanation and suggestions for teaching this.","Decisions about the suitability of tools could be made at scale to ensure that they are trustworthy and equitable without undermining teachers' pedagogy. Teachers can advocate for the access to use specific AI tools in the classroom but there should be a cross-sectoral body that ensures the safety of such tools prior to their introduction to the classroom and checks on the ongoing quality and safety of the AI tool as it is updated. These changes will need to be accompanied by significant teacher professional development, both by the system to understand the above demands but also by the professional associations who are subject based and can help teachers maximise the effectiveness of AI for their discipline and in their classrooms","â€¢  This technology must be incorporated into education, much like the use of computers and software were originally taught as a specific class in secondary schools and then was incorporated as a basic technical skill","â€¢  This exposure and digital literacy in technology must begin in secondary study and be appropriately scaffolded into tertiary study, establishing a strong foundational familiarity with tools prior to more sophisticated application in a higher education setting.","â€¢  Short courses (both in higher education and vocational education) in generative AI may help formalise a sufficiently structured curriculum that addresses both technical competency as well as anchoring it in ethical use, critical thinking, evaluation and scenarios for use.","â€¢  It is essential that generative AI is implemented and integrated across all fields of study to ensure that all students have the opportunity to build familiarity. This will ensure ethical and critical engagement with the appropriate use of such technologies in society, and preparing future workforce and cultural leadership in policy and government.","â€¢  Standards for generative AI use in education contexts should be considered, but also take into account the rapidly changing environment and technology. Standards should not limit and constrain institutionsâ€™ need for agility and flexibility in their responses. Standards could relate to the specific types of generative AI that are acceptable â€“ these standards could include consideration of data management, privacy, security, as well as broader terms of service, contracts (for paid tools).","â€¢  The rapid development of generative AI and proliferation of companies will also prompt a range of new â€˜edtechâ€™ products and services that could create a financial pressure for educational institutions as they attempt to ensure appropriate equity and inclusion for cohorts.","need to support and enable through proactive programs, First Nations inclusion and leadership","The inquiry should encompass how to introduce content relating to understanding Generative AI into the national curriculum.","1. a more coherent approach be adopted to the dissemination of information relating to the impacts of Generative Al on Academic Integrity from bodies such as TEQSA and the Federal Department of Education.","2. an allocation of dedicated workload commensurate to the need for Additional professional development to support academic staff understand the options that may be available to them to accommodate generative Al in their units/courses, particularly in relation to assessment. This is particularly critical for staff on sessional contracts. Thus, consideration should be given to one off grants for institutions to support their staff in this way.","3. TEQSA and ASQA, or the Department of Education, monitor the different impacts of Generative Al on specific groups of students, such as, First Nations, International and those with a disability.","4. the Department of Education or Universities Australia establish an information hub for the sector, to coordinate relevant information for staff and students and that pathways be developed that coherently supports and extend this information.","That TEQSA, as the national body for regulating and assuring the quality of higher education providers, assumes national leadership in developing standards and frameworks to guide and support the higher education sector in maintaining academic integrity in the context of generative AI. This aligns with TEQSAâ€™s national leadership in the promotion of academic integrity and effective responses to other threats to integrity through its publications, partnerships and professional development activities.","The House Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training (the Committee) should consider whether AI tools that explicitly (and as their primary business model) market or provide cheating services are within the purview of the TEQSA Act in relation to the provision of contract cheating services.","That the Department of Education undertakes a review of the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2021 to ensure effective sector-wide responses to the use of generative AI in higher education, in consultation with key stakeholders, including Universities Australia, bodies representing non-university providers and key experts in this field.","That the Committee considers the significant shift that the integration of generative AI technologies in education represents for educators and makes recommendations regarding the need to invest in this workforce transformation. In particular, the Committee should recommend investment by government and the higher education sector in the reconceptualization of teaching, learning and assessment to leverage the benefits of generative AI and address the risk posed to assessment integrity and potential data security and privacy issues. Options for developing resources, guidelines and training for educators at a national level need to be considered.","That the Committee recommends a national agenda for ongoing research and collaboration and educational initiatives that seek to maximise the benefits of generative AI across different disciplines, address risks, evaluate the impact of generative AI on learning, and support development of AI literacy among staff and students.","That the Committee recommends future initiatives, programs and projects addressing the use of generative AI in the education sector incorporate consultation with academics and researchers from a range of discipline areas, as well as key stakeholders outside the education sector, especially professional associations, accreditation bodies, registration bodies and employers.","That the Committeeâ€™s findings and recommendations provide the basis for a coherent and cohesive national approach to the use of generative AI that covers all levels and types of education providers, from primary school through to the higher education sector.","Comprehensive ethical guidelines and regulations need to be established to govern the use of generative AI in the education system and protect the rights and well-being of students.","Educators should be provided with clear guidelines and support to incorporate discussions of ethical considerations into their curriculum, fostering a culture of integrity and responsible technology use.","That the Committee makes recommendations to higher education providers on the curation and sharing of best practice, including case studies and exemplars to build capability and awareness of ways to engage with generative AI.","That the Committee makes specific recommendations addressing current and anticipated intellectual property issues related to the use of generative AI by students and staff, which includes issues under relevant Australian and international laws and intellectual property agreements.","That any development of generative AI standards in Australia include reference to Indigenous Cultural and Intelletual Property (ICIP) and Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) and that risks that Indigenous knowledges and intellectual property will be incorporated into generative AI and used without appropriate attribution or acknowledgement are minimised.","That the Committee highlights the need for a diverse range of interested parties and stakeholders to be included in future decisions and actions related to the use of generative AI, in particular the perspectives of those who may be underrepresented in government and education decision-making bodies, including students, people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, those experiencing social and economic disadvantage, and people with disabilities.","That the Committee considers equity of access to generative AI and the ways that institutional policies and resource allocation for AI will impact on student capabilities, opportunities and outcomes.","That the Committee provide recommendations to higher education providers regarding licensing agreements for relevant generative AI tools to ensure ready access for students and staff.","That the Committee consider any inequities in access to basic infrastructure in Australia including access to and costs associated with internet and mobile telephony services, and how these will impact any recommendations for the use of generative AI in education, including levels of government investment required.","The Parliamentary Inquiry recommend the use of the current HEPPP (Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program) to address the needs of students experiencing social disadvantage in relation to digital skills and digital access to generative AI tools.","That the Committee make recommendations on national regulation of the use of generative AI in the Australian context, where its use in education is just one aspect of its broader use in Australian society.","That the Committee recognise that evolution of generative AI in the education system is in its early stages, with AI developing at an exponentially rapid rate, and guide the formulation of a strategic vision for Australiaâ€™s management, regulation and effective use of generative AI in this rapidly changing environment.","(1) consistent with international responses to AI, including the safe management of foundation models and forms of generative AI, new regulation is needed in this area and arguably a principal piece of legislation that governs AI. The regulation of AI should also be part of a wider and comprehensive review of laws that intersects with and is complimentary to this sector. We need to continue to balance risk proportionately by identifying the highest risks in this area and mechanisms for outlier issues of concern whilst continuing to encourage innovation and derive the truly significant societal benefits of AI;","That Australia follow international leads to consider national regulation on the use of generative AI.","That any national recommendations on generative AI in higher education be developed after broad consultation with key stakeholders, including accreditation and registration bodies given their role in curriculum, assessment and assurance of learning.","Australia should also closely consider prioritising its alignment with other key export markets, and avoid fragmentation, and multi-jurisdictional compliance regimes that make investment unpalatable, and research and development activity challenging.

Offering the most comprehensive training for work ready students (both domestic and international) and in research and development. Briefly, areas for current consideration from overseas countries regulating AI, include consideration of certain prohibited AI activities, exemptions for internal research and development without prejudice to commercialisation, treatment of open source software, and risk classifications for intersecting educational activities and AI, such as higher risk requirements for use of this AI in admissions and academic assessment8;","AI safety research and development, and optimising innovation breadth, needs to be properly and comprehensively supported. The prioritisation of resourcing, coordination of public and private, and increasing the scale of piloting and use, and skills training in niche evaluation assessments of AI, is important. If Australia is to compete on the global stage and drive economic and productivity growth, the Governmentâ€™s continued focus on and increased investment in initiatives to support our digital strategy, and the AI ecosystem in Australia, by supporting the education sector is truly fundamental. Our global counterparts are expanding their investment in AI and capabilities and Australia cannot afford to be left behind. We have set out in the Annexure to this submission some examples of broader principles that we have developed that are education specific to help build consensus on governance frameworks to manage AI safety risks.","Evidence informed decision making We want to encourage innovative, safe practice for the use of generative AI in education. There is significant potential for generative AI tools to be used to improve education outcomes, however we currently have no research to support any decisions. Educators need to be supported to be able to make evidence-informed decisions about how generative AI can be used in their practice.","Further consideration of the application of the recommendations of the General Comment 25 (2021) to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child developed to specifically address the rights of the child in the digital age.","Extensive ongoing consultation with children and young people is undertaken to not only inform proposed actions but to also uncover creative child-led solutions and insights with respect to their education and the use of generative AI as well as any unintended consequences.","Commitment to a strong research agenda to understand the potential and risks of generative AI as well as to evaluate its use in educational settings and the reasons for its rapid uptake.

Development, for example, of a specific supporting guide for the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (2018) addressing the benefits and risks of emerging technologies in research would enable all Australian organisations conducting research, to identify and consistently manage use of these technologies in their research and training programs.","Recommendation 4: Identify policy and program opportunities to encourage and support sustainable collaborations between educators in schools serving disadvantaged communities and their colleagues in Australian universities with relevant expertise and interests, to help address the digital divide, specifically in relation to access to and use of generative AI tools.","Clear differentiation to be accepted or evident between the learning areas and subjects, rather than generic â€˜rulesâ€™ for generative AI use or the limitation of AI in schools. Tertiary institutions, transdisciplinary inquiry and traditional subject disciplines are demonstrating different approaches to the generative language models (LLMs), such as first steps in an effective discipline-specific or evidence-based research strategies.","Public support, trust and confidence must be built, and a vision communicated for the safe and effective use of generative AI software and tools in professional teaching standards, in early learning centres, schools and teacher education institutions. A human-centric vision within the anticipated draft AI framework must include the principles of inclusion, equity, access, quality, safety, and security.","The use of generative AI tools for learning, differentiation and assessment in automated systems and augmented intelligence systems, for a broader understanding of generative AI software should be introduced as a key element of Initial Teacher Education.","Education ministers and education departments in the states and territories adopt a nationally consistent approach to governance and standards and remove the current regulatory misalignment through calling for only a focus on local decision-making. Further, a continuous improvement national strategy with an agile approach is required to reduce teacher polarisation between AI users in government sectors, other jurisdictions, and education systems. There is a need to meet the national challenge and strict national control, with specific AI risk mitigation and regulation for areas such as the often- discussed â€˜guard railsâ€™ for cybersecurity, child protection, privacy, IP and consumer protection and information accuracy of student use or source attribution of generative AI tools.","Investigation of an equitable and accessible national funding program, such as grants, scholarships, and awards for professional teaching associations to sponsor and evaluate free professional development for Australian teachers in early childhood, school, and higher education sectors. These areas might include recommendations for classroom practice, curriculum initiatives, action research, radical changes in student assessment practices, or the use of an educative approach to anti-plagiarism as well as testing of detection software for academic honesty, originality, and attribution.","Recommendation 1: Policy making should be both anticipatory and responsive to systemically manage the risks and seize the opportunities facing the Australian education sector AI technology is being introduced before there are adequate policies for guiding productive use and mitigating harms in education. This means a lag time between the introduction of AI and policy development, which also contributes to largely reactive policy making. There needs to be both anticipatory policy making (to assess both development and potential harms and opportunities) and responsive policy making (to guide existing use). Attention to future possibilities - based on past and present needs â€“ has the potential to address the systemic risks and opportunities which the education sector currently faces at a time of unprecedented uncertainty.","Recommendation 2: There needs to be meaningful, participatory and collective approaches to address the complexity of AI in education policy making Involving a diverse range of community members and education stakeholders at all stages of policy development and implementation will help to anticipate risks, build trust and co-create principles to inform complex decision-making measures. This is particularly important in anticipatory policymaking which must be responsive to local, regional, and national needs. This genuinely multi-scalar and multi-stakeholder approach throughout the entire process will lead to more timely decisions in the future. Part of this will require distributing socio-technical expertise and embedding opportunities for collective learning, experimentation, and policymaking about the development and use of AI and emerging technologies in education. In particular, there is a need to distribute expertise and embed these opportunities in a way that is accessible to and involves those from underrepresented backgrounds who might otherwise lack the opportunity and resources to participate in policy co-creation processes. To ensure that this collaborative work (which is systemic, collective, and cross-sectoral) becomes embedded across research, policy, and practice - there is a need for long-term government funding to sustain this initiative.","Recommendation 3: Establish a cross-sector representative body and knowledgesharing hub which embeds a research-policy-practice approach toward the governance of AI across all Australian education contexts. All areas of education are already and likely to be impacted by the use of AI and all stakeholders need opportunities to shape the implementation of AI in Australian education systems. A representative cross-sector independent body should include members from government, departmental agencies (e.g. Department of Education, Department of Industry, Science and Resources), regulatory bodies relating to education (e.g. TEQSA, ASQA and ACECQA), higher education (both STEM and HASS disciplines), schooling and early childhood sectors (including diverse range of students for all sectors), the education technology industry, teacher associations and parent groups. The body should be established to: (1) oversee the development of AI in Australian education with a focus on the risks and possibilities of open A.I. development; (2) produce regular issue-specific publications and events for the groups it represents; and, (3) maintain a set of iteratively revised guidelines and learning resources for the field.","An appraisal of Australiaâ€™s AI capability is needed with a focus on education, training, and research. The RRIR paper notes that â€œAustralia has capability in AI-related areas like computer vision and robotics, and the social and governance aspects of AI, but its core fundamental capacity in LLMs and related areas is relatively weakâ€. It is not clear whether we are producing enough â€œexpertsâ€ in core fields through research training. Nor do we have a whole-of-sector view to AI industry workforce â€“ inclusive of education as a major industry â€“ so that we can be confident we are producing cohorts of graduates with the foundational education and skills to meet the AI challenges of our time.3","Tracking and evaluating the deployment and uptake of generative AI in education contexts will also be vital. The recent release of the UTS AI Governance report is a useful model.4 One of the biggest issues â€“ flagged in the Inquiryâ€™s terms of reference â€“ is the risk of entrenching social disadvantage and of perpetuating racist, homophobic and sexist stereotypes. Developing and investing in a Generative-AI index akin to the Digital Inclusion Index5 would be one way of tracking and evaluating models based on set of criteria so students, the broader public and governments can make informed choices about uptake.","There is a major opportunity for the development of Australian models â€“ datasets, LLMs, and significantly, small language models. This is a research infrastructure agenda and is also brings in large public datasets that could offer opportunities for generative AI in Australia. We would single out (as per the RRIR paper) large datasets such as the Bureau of Meteorology, Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the National Library of Australiaâ€™s Trove.","1. Universities should be supported to lead public debate about the ethics of AI, as university graduates should be equipped not just as users of AI, but future leaders of ethical AI development and adoption. Educational programs for educators and students should therefore include all known ethical issues, risks and challenges.","2. Investments will need to be made in the higher education workforce to: â€¢ develop their knowledge and skills in the productive and ethical use of AI to enable them to create relevant curricula for students; â€¢ enhance their teaching capabilities to enable the use of intentional pedagogies that develop uniquely human skills,  and â€¢ build their assessment design abilities so they can reconceptualise assessment to maintain course integrity.","3. The Australian Qualifications Framework must be capable of enabling the necessary curriculum renewal, particularly in its framings, definitions and specifications for knowledge and skills.","4. Professional accreditation bodies, industry and universities will need to be aligned in their positions in order to enable responsive and coherent courses.","5. Federal sponsorship would best enable the sector-wide collaboration needed to conceptualise and guide assessment renewal while maintaining the quality and reputation of Australian higher education.","appropriate use of generative AI, including open acknowledgement that it has been used (and why). Most students (and staff) will come to appreciate that moderate use of generative AI (for example, producing literature summaries) is appropriate, but blanket use (such as churning out an entire essay) is not â€“ though even moderate use should, for the foreseeable future, be acknowledged even in situations where the use of AI is sanctioned. A comparable situation is the use of online tools like Wikipedia: good students know, or quickly realise, that it should be regarded as a source of information, and not necessarily a definitive one.","â€¢ ensuring that users understand the limitations and risks of generative AI, including, for example, the recognition that some tools could involve the intentional or unintentional sharing of personal, private, or confidential information. There are also risks, at least at present, with the accuracy of AI tools. Their results â€“ including those provided by so-called â€˜expert systemsâ€™ â€“ can be very convincing, even when wrong. The limitations of facial recognition tools, for example, are well known, and are, in part, a consequence of the way they are â€˜trainedâ€™ (see below). Generative AI is subject to similar shortcomings and raises the possibility not only of inaccurate information but intentionally or unintentionally created and convincing misinformation.","â€¢ user anonymity, except in cases where the AI may be part of a subscription or fee-for-service system (in which case this will need to be made clear to users)","â€¢ equity of access, as a way to help minimise algorithmic bias but also to ensure the widest possible benefit from these tools","â€¢ transparency about inputs, including those used to â€˜trainâ€™ the AI engine, those employed by the AI engine to generate outputs, and those provided by the user, especially when, in either case, proprietary content may be involved (though this would not extend to revealing information about the AIâ€™s underlying algorithms or system architecture)","more work is required to understand how such tools can be best leveraged to improve outcomes. To facilitate this transition, further and significant investment in comprehensive professional development programs for educators,is necessary to equip them with the necessary skills in data analysis and digital and AI literacy.","By implementing robust regulations and transparent practices, the government can foster a responsible and trustworthy educational environment that maximises the benefits of AI while preserving academic and research integrity.","International collaborations help align regulations and processes and share best practices and learnings.","Universities will inevitably need to adapt their offerings to respond to generative AI. This will include reconsidering assessment to include more authentic, continuous forms of assessment where the opportunity for academic misconduct is reduced. Universities will need to ensure Higher Degree by Research (HDR) candidates, for example, understand the importance of generating their own content, noting that writing is intimately linked with cognition. Universities will also need to ensure their students and staff are AI literate.","â€¢ Universities and industry need to agree on a set of guidelines on the use of Gen-AI.","â€¢ Universities should help direct what agencies are going to be responsible for implementing some of these guidelines.","â€¢ In the short-term focus more on education and prevention programs to help learners and educators understand ethical, legal and responsible use of Gen-AI.","â€¢ Work collaboratively with high schools who are already encouraging students to use Gen-AI so we can build upon the already developed capabilities is critical. o However, note that not all schools do encourage students to use Gen-AI and student may therefore come to tertiary education with different levels of competence and understanding of Gen-AI tools. This makes things even more complex for educators.","â€¢ Have measures in place to prevent and detect misuses of Gen-AI.","â€¢ Promote exchange of experience and success stories across the education sector as we navigate through this new challenge.","â€¢ Establish training/fellowship programs specific to Gen-AI to help staff upskills and innovate.","â€¢ Promote the collaboration between AI researchers and other areas.","1. Commit to all students receiving instruction in AI literacy and working with library bodies on implementation.","2. The Department of Education to collect and report national data on school library staffing and resourcing to identify students at risk of not receiving adequate information and AI literacy resources.","3. Government funding for the creation of programs to upskill library and teaching staff to be AI literate, and to be able to teach AI literacy to students.","4. The Department of Education to work with librarians and teacher librarians on the developmentof new tools, digital platforms and programs to support AI in education.","5. That a research program is put in place to monitor outputs of generative AI tools deployed in an educational setting, with tool providers committing to continual improvement in response to findings.","alian education system would benefit from the enormous expertise offered by the higher education sector given that Australia is home to many of the  worldâ€™s leading researchers in AI in education, Learning Analytics, and higher education  researchers in teaching, feedback and assessment design. This expertise must be woven together.1 This could be achieved in several ways and UTS recommends consideration of the following models: â€¢  An extension of the model proposed by Ms Loble AM (described below as the Australian Forum on  Quality Digital Education) to include, where relevant, a partnership with the higher education  sector. â€¢   If separate from Ms Lobleâ€™s model, a National Centre for AI in education or an ARC Centre of  Excellence tuned to the needs of not only researchers advancing knowledge and innovation  technologically, but serving practitioners in co-designing, testing and evaluating what works in  diverse contexts. Australian Indigenous educational innovation and challenges must also be a  hallmark of this centre.2","The adoption of national guidelines to maximise opportunities while safeguarding against legal risks. These guidelines should support public and private sector organisations to comply with relevant laws and encompass co- and self-regulatory measures. The consultation underway by the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources Safe and responsible AI in Australia is a positive step in this direction","Convene generative AI challenges to catalyse applied research and cross-sector collaboration. Teams of academia, industry partners, and educational institutions would be funded to explore the potential applications of generative AI in education. These projects would focus on developing innovative solutions, evaluating their effectiveness, and addressing specific challenges faced in different educational contexts.","Hold annual conferences on generative AI in Education. Annual conferences would bring together thought leaders and the strongest examples of practice, as a way to build Australiaâ€™s capability. These could be specialised for different stakeholders and agendas (e.g., pedagogical, technical, ethical, governance) as well as ensuring there was productive knowledge integration. A strong emphasis on translating into practice will promote innovation diffusion.","Establish a generative AI educational impact evidence hub to foster both domestic and international collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Resource the development of a collective intelligence website that assists the community in sharing, finding, and debating the emerging evidence as generative AI is evaluated in different educational contexts. UTS has experience in prototyping such infrastructures.","Convene an expert panel to review options for national generative AI infrastructure. Amidst concerns that generative AI is owned and driven by technology companies, we should consider developing a national capability for both research and public services, with the possibility of increased fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics when the infrastructure is completely under our own control.","Develop comprehensive ethical guidelines and frameworks specifically tailored for the use of generative AI in education. These guidelines should encompass aspects such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, fairness, and accountability. They should also consider the unique ethical considerations related to student data and learner outcomes","the education sector urgently needs robust responses to the following questions: â€¢ What are proven approaches to transitioning assessment practices and curriculum renewal at scale? For instance, are direct observation/oral defence sessions scalable (e.g., for hundreds of students in a cohort), does it cost more than current assessments, and if more, is this justified by the rigour of assurance of learning they provide? Does a switch to program-level assessment create the staff time and curriculum space to introduce the triangulation of student evidence now required? â€¢ How well do different ways of using generative AI tools translate across different teaching and learning contexts, and do we understand why there is inevitably variation? There are now myriad, educationally-grounded proposals for how ChatGPT might be used â€” what is missing is the coordinated tracking of evidence of how well these work across different contexts. â€¢ How do we build critical AI literacy among students of different ages and stages, such that it becomes a lifelong capability, and does not age rapidly with technical advances? â€¢ What are the most effective ways to upskill academics, short and longer term? Every university has a centre for teaching innovation bringing wide expertise, including Academic Language and Literacies, Library, Course Program Design, Assessment Design. All of these have been engaged in the rapid response to generative AI over the last 6 months, but there has not yet been time to consolidate, share and discuss innovations. â€¢ How do we tune generative AI for learning? The dominant Large Language Models and conversational interfaces were not developed for education. These can be further tuned with in-depth disciplinary texts, and prompt engineering to shape learning conversations. Some universities are beginning to build the infrastructure to conduct such applied R&D, while others will depend on them sharing the outputs in forms they can adopt and adapt, open source or via commercial products.","Staff will however need institutional support and resources to achieve this, including greater workload allocations for course design and student assessment and frameworks for considering what types of AI usage might constitute plagiarism. There should also be in place appropriate institutional policies and procedures to ensure best practice is in place and that human oversight on the use of AI is embedded.","The use of Artificial Intelligence in higher education should be human centric, with appropriate guardrails in place to regulate its effective use as a tool to improve access to and experience of education. It should also be seen as a mechanism to better equip our researchers, technological staff and others engaged in research activities to undertake their work more effectively and assist with innovation and knowledge discovery. However, it should not replace the human element in teaching, learning and research activities. It should also ensure human oversight remains in important student support services, and in administration and technical roles. Furthermore, both staff and students should be supported to learn and use AI technology in a responsible and ethical manner. Where it is embedded or seen as a vital component as part of the learning experience, the education provider should ensure that all students and staff have equitable access to the use of AI.","Support ground-up staff led assessment of AI usage in their disciplines. Staff are best placed to decide how and where AI usage is appropriate in the context of their specific discipline and course content. Blanket regulatory or institutional policy approaches to adopting AI should be avoided in relation to the delivery of teaching and research, particularly where it is deemed to be a â€˜cost savingâ€™ measure. Where AI is adopted, to ensure it is used successfully and responsibly as a tool in teaching, learning and curricular, staff need professional development opportunities to learn about AI and additional time allocation to develop and engage in new modes of assessment. This will ensure students of Australian institutions are truly attaining the desired learning outcomes.","Regulators of Australian Higher Education providers Education Regulators (primarily TEQSA) will need to be conscious of the implication of AI on learning pedagogies and be empowered to ensure that learning outcomes are maintained","Support for higher education staff and the professional development of staff in the use of AI Staff need to be equipped with the necessary capabilities and support to effectively adapt their teaching and learning activities to the emerging AI environment, including appropriate training in AI usage. This should extend to all staff who are engaged with teaching, learning and research, as well as administrative and professional/technical staff, where there is the expectation or necessity for AI to be part of their activities. In particular, casual, sessional, contract and other staff employed non-permanently should be supported by the institution in relation to their professional development around the use of AI.","Implement guardrails as AI develops to provide better outcomes The NTEU supports the establishment of regulatory guardrails to direct the development and use of AI in both the education context and more broadly. The implementation of good practice principles drawing from ethical frameworks will help direct the development of AI in a positive manner and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Such principles should address the need for: â€¢ Equity â€¢ Accessibility and inclusion â€¢ Prevention of bias and discrimination â€¢ Transparency and accountability These principles should underpin the premise that the application of AI should be beneficial and not result in the lessening of current industrial protections, human rights and guarantees on human expression and freedoms.","Understanding the potential and risks of genAI is a cross-sector, cross-discipline, societal concern; national priorities should reflect this through recognition of and support for interdisciplinarity and the social sciences in genAI innovation across sectors. - Recommendation 1: support interdisciplinary and cross -sector learning for ethical engagement with genAI, in the short term through support for targeted professional learning or microcredentials, and in the mid-term through addressing concerns raised regarding the jobs ready graduates package of reforms","Evidence is a central requirement of ethical AI (merit in the National Statement; justification and transparency in many AI ethics frameworks). It is crucial that investments in EdTech are underpinned by evidence that any tools used will support the outcomes they claim to target. Support the critique, creation, and dissemination of evidence regarding claims of genAI supporting learning through: - Recommendation 2: Development of funding streams, and support for innovative approaches to evidence development and sharing across sectors, regarding genAI. By its nature this work must include social scientists which may require new funding streams, or/and reform of the R&D tax credit.","Recommendation 3: Support of interdisciplinary teams for genAI research both on fundamental evaluation of tool uses, and the dissemination of this evidence with and across education systems (including educators, learners, and developers).","Learning environments are one space where genAI will clearly have significant impact; understanding this impact and appropriate (dis)engagement with genAI in learning requires a focus on the fundamental purposes and processes of learning. - Recommendation 4: Values underpin both our aims in education, and our aims for genAI, shaping what we learn (e.g., â€˜AI literacyâ€™), and how we learn (e.g., new AI tools). Support the convening of public fora and engagement activities to develop collective, democratic, values-led responses regarding the kinds of futures Australians want in use of genAI in education.","Recommendation 5: Understanding, evaluating, and sharing effective practices: There can be no strengths of genAI in education without teachers who will work with, create approaches for, and thus need to learn about genAI. This has implications, drawing on our other recommendations. o Any consideration of and planning cycles towards use of genAI in education should be with respect to the values and aims identified in Recommendation 4 o Resourcing should be provided to develop models to assess AI literacy across the range of stakeholders, and identify needs and strategies to develop this literacy; resources derived from this activity can feed into guidelines to help navigate the ethics of genAI (Recommendation 6) o Support should be provided for bespoke professional learning for teachers from all sectors, to develop algorithmic literacy to learn to engage with genAI and capacity for designing to learn with genAI tools Recommendation 1; Recommendation 7). o Evidence should underpin any incorporation of genAI (see Recommendation 3). This evidence should be shared and co-developed with and by teachers, informed by student voice, and in mentoring and partnerships with research universities and education institutions. It may also be appropriate to target resourcing to creation of evidence-informed models that encode shared values (Recommendation 4), and the body of existing evidence regarding learning technologies, to create tuned models or/and educationally-tailored system prompts (prompts that modify user input to provide context). Sharing among teachers has been shown to be an effective mechanism for supporting innovative approaches, particularly through creation of toolkit resources that provide practical guidance for design for learning alongside evidence and high-level principles.","Recommendation 6: The concerns of applying genAI in education in Australia specifically are unclear, with few practical guidelines available for stakeholders to understand or navigate these issues.

Target schools that are most impacted by digital divides","The NT is actively contributing to the National Al Taskforce (the taskforce), which was established by the Education Ministers Meeting in February 2023 to scope, prioritise and sequence the activity to develop a national Al framework for schools. The inquiry would benefit from leveraging the efforts of the taskforce, which has involved high level collaboration across jurisdictions, relevant organisations and collated emerging credible research, to inform the development of a national Al framework for schools.","Recommendation 1: Reverse bans on generative AI systems in schools introduced by state education departments and establish institutional access licencing agreements across the education sector.","Recommendation 2: Introduce age-appropriate AI instruction in Australian classrooms, supported by appropriate educator training and purpose-built AI tools or institutional access licences for commercial AI products.","Recommendation 3: Provide professional development opportunities, supported by professional development leave and other incentives, to teach existing educators how to engage with AI both inside and outside the classroom.","Recommendation 4: Require the inclusion of AI literacy training as part of initial teacher training programs.","Recommendation 5: Encourage the development of assessment guidance by education departments that is both resilient to AI developments and embraces opportunities presented by AI.","Recommendation 6: Develop and provide ethics and AI data privacy training for educators.","Recommendation 7: Develop appropriate interventions to protect young peopleâ€™s mental health, and deeply sensitive information.","ACARA understands the parallels that exist between curriculum implementation and teacher professional development in building capacity for teaching and learning with and about AI. Through the provision of professional development, with a focus on the intent of the curriculum, teachers will gain an equivalent understanding to that of their students about the purpose, use, structure and risks of using generative AI and other types of AI more broadly. ACARA will be developing some professional learning modules and would be keen to partner with jurisdictions and sectors and teacher professional associations to support teachers to plan and implement the curriculum relevant to understanding AI","ACARA recommends that all materials designed to guide educators about the use of AI should provide clear definitions of what we mean by AI and generative AI, and make it clear that there are a range of AI types; for example, Chat GPT is only one example of generative AI.","Students have preferences for using digital tools creatively and responsibly, to try new things and to fail as part of personal growth. This should be considered in the context of how the curriculum supports them to do this and how using and designing AI may play an important part in engaging students in their learning and providing opportunities for their future lives.","ACARA is currently providing information to key educational stakeholders to support them with questions about AI in the Australian Curriculum and is planning to develop more detailed information to show why it is important to teach about AI while recognising that teachers and students are using it, in and out of the classroom. The ability to have discussions about the ethical consideration (eg cheating) and the potential limitations (eg if you donâ€™t know the content how will you know whether Chat GPT is correct), but also the benefits of AI (eg retrieving and synthesising a large volume of information) is essential.","There is considerable concern about students using AI to cheat on tasks set by the teacher, and particularly assessment tasks. ACARA as the assessment authority could consider developing a range of strategies/suggestions to use AI without the concern about cheating.","ACARA has been tasked with exploring the development and delivery of optional support resources to implement the national curriculum as part of Action 19 in the National Teacher Workforce Action Plan. There may be the opportunity to look at the synergies between future work related to AI and activities related to Action 19.","ACARA could provide more explicit advice on how the English curriculum can support students to be more critical of information they read and are exposed to when using digital systems. This could also include highlighting how the critical and creative thinking general capability can be addressed as part of this approach.","UA recommends that universities retain the autonomy to manage the opportunities and risks associated with generative AI within their own institutions. Coordination across the sector could be encouraged through the development of best practice guidance and sector-specific standards for the use of generative AI in academia. Importantly, students need to be educated in the practical and ethical implications of generative AI to be adequately prepared for the future workforce. Work to equip students with these skills is already underway across UAâ€™s member institutions.","Within the field of education, the crafting of any regulatory framework should be mindful of specific risks and impacts for educational uses, such as: â€¢ the need for transparent disclosure of the training data and algorithms that underpin educational products so that they can be genuinely evaluated by government and educational institutions to ensure they are free of bias. The onus should be on EdTech developers to make this information intelligible â€¢ a requirement for humans to remain accountable for all AI-assisted decision making. That is, AI can provide input and information and even recommendations, but decision making and accountability can not be delegated to a non-human and recommendations must be able to be over-ridden by a human â€¢ an absolute requirement to respect and protect student and staff privacy, with clear legal requirements for appropriate data handling, storage and disposal to be applied in all models and uses. This requirement should be crafted in such a way as to also provide protection against surveillance usage â€¢ intellectual property considerations, particularly as they relate to sensitive research data and proposals as well as assessment design â€¢ the need for developers to ensure that they are mindful of, and seek to eliminate, bias and discrimination through the data the model is trained on, the design of the model and its suggested applications â€¢ a requirement for educational administrators and institutions to ensure models and their applications are evaluated for bias and that their use is governed by institutional policies, and that adherence is monitored. As a final point, TEQSA notes that consideration should be given the data on which AI is trained to ensure local contexts are adequately represented. This is important to avoid erasing Australian and indigenous culture in a sea of US-centric internet content. Setting down requirements for those creating AI models to be purposeful and considered about the training data can help create inclusive and diverse AI systems.","Recommendation 1: Children and young people be specifically consulted in an ongoing way about policy decisions in respect of the use of generative AI in the Australian education system.","Recommendation 2: The principle of the â€˜best interests of the childâ€™ should be the primary test used to inform all policy decisions about the use of generative AI in Australiaâ€™s education system.","Recommendation 3: The principle that generative AI is to supplement and support learning, and not as a replacement for teaching staff, should be adopted as a foundational principle to inform all policy decisions about the use of generative AI in Australiaâ€™s education system.","Recommendation 4: The personal data of students collected by generative AI tools must not be sold to third parties or provided to interoperable services or tools outside of the product being used in the classroom for which consent has been obtained","Recommendation 5: Policies should mandate rigorous and continual evaluation and validation processes, together with regular independent auditing, to identify and mitigate algorithmic bias in any generative AI tools used in the Australian education system","Recommendation 6: Policies should explicitly prohibit the use of generative AI tools in educational settings to create deceptive or malicious content.","Recommendation 7: Policies should more broadly encourage the development and use of generative AI tools for content verification, allowing individuals to accurately identify AI-generated content.","Recommendation 8: The Commission supports the development of consistent national standards and guidelines to ensure the responsible and ethical use of generative AI tools in Australian schools.","Recommendation 9: Professional development and training should be provided to teachers to ensure that they are able to engage with generative AI tools in ways that harness its potential benefits while protecting against the recognised risks","Recommendation 10: Schools should introduce comprehensive digital literacy programs to provide students with the skills needed to engage with generative AI tools in a responsible and ethical way.","Recommendation 11: Generative AI tools being used in an educational settings should be required to meet minimum requirements relating to privacy, data security, algorithmic bias and discrimination, and content verification, including requirements for regular audits and independent reviews of the tools.","Recommendation 12: The Commission recommends continued investment in research and development to support the use of generative AI tools in educational settings, and an understanding of their impact.","Recommendation 13: Policies should encourage partnerships to improve access to resources, expertise, and technology infrastructure, while ensuring that these are pursued in an appropriate way that recognises the particular educational context.","Recommendation 14: Policies should also encourage the development and use of AI-enabled educational resources that are specifically designed to address the needs of disadvantaged cohorts","Recommendation 15: Policies should prioritise providing targeted training and capacity building programs for teachers and students in schools with a higher proportion of disadvantaged students","Recommendation 16: Addressing the digital divide and ensuring digital equity needs to be a priority in the use of generative AI in the Australian education system.

We need to understand and articulate the potential and evolving role that GAI can play in the teaching and learning experience.","GAI will form part of a wider system of assessment that collectively gives educatorsâ€™ evidence of each studentâ€™s authentic, multi-faceted learning journey. Studentsâ€™ use of GAI in education settings will therefore need to be scaffolded with new skills, including universal delivery of: critical thinking, digital literacy, personal communication and writing style, and opportunities to develop higher-order thinking skills. Teachers will also need to be (re)skilled to provide this scaffolding. In higher education, there is a need for the sector to work closely with professional and accreditation bodies to understand current and future learning and assessment requirements in the context of competency certification.","The Australian Government needs to hold developers of publicly-used GAI resources accountable for the veracity of output in education settings. As for the use of any new technology, it will be necessary to think through regulatory compliance and broader ethical considerations. Developments internationally should be monitored carefully, particularly for regulatory responses applicable to education providers.\nQuality, ethical outputs from GAI require quality inputs. Australian higher education can help ensure GAI is fit for purpose - avoiding inaccurate, irrelevant, biased, or deceptive outputs, or information that is counter to either regulatory or teachersâ€™ pedagogical design. This can be done by undertaking ongoing due diligence to ensure the inputs of GAI are relevant to educational settings, and that the outputs of GAI in education settings are robust, ethical, increase the quality of learning outcomes, and are protecting the reputation of Australian education. GAI systems will need appropriate controls to allow educational institutions to undertake this work. Misconduct is also a known risk, where some students may pass off AI-generated work as their own. Widespread evidence from within the field of academic integrity suggests that students are well-intentioned but may be opportunistic when under pressure. Misconduct - both unintentional and intentional - can be mitigated when education institutions provide students and teachers with clear advice and guidance and sanctioned alternatives, including appropriately-trained GAI, as trusted, readily-accessible options. Risks and challenges can be mitigated with transparency of use. Policy should dictate that where a student or researcher uses GAI tools this should be disclosed to assessors, reviewers, and other audiences, just as referencing is used to disclose access to archive materials.","Implemented well, GAI has the potential to improve access to and the accessibility of learning and enhanced learning outcomes for disadvantaged learners. It has the potential to complement classroom teaching with smart, adaptive, and personalised formative feedback at scale and high frequency for individual learners, in modes that suit individual circumstances. It will be important to work with experts, advocates, and communities to understand the potential for different groups of students experiencing disadvantage. GAI is best delivered at scale via Australiaâ€™s strong, existing education infrastructure as part of enrolment. Australiaâ€™s education institutions already include a wide ecosystem of expertise and resourcing that comes from teachers, administrators, student mentors, families, and scaffolding by others, including education scholarship programs. Students in Australian education institutions should receive equal access to quality-assured GAI tools via these existing channels, including equal-access to the associated personal scaffolding required to use GAI ethically and effectively, including critical and digital literacy. Further, partners in Australian education - including scholarship managers, advocates, and community leaders for First Nations students, refugees, learners with disability, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups - can provide valuable connections to studentsâ€™ communities in combination with teaching and learning ecosystems within institutions.","There is extensive evidence in the Australian context for the impact of personal feedback on student confidence and other academic success metrics. Studiosity can offer the Minister for Education this evidence, and access to early evidence within the higher education sector for the use of GAI on student engagement, confidence, and outcomes.","Australian education is already globally renowned. There is an urgent need to adjust standards to incorporate the use of GAI to protect and augment those high standards. Use of GAI in Australian education settings should include: 1. Human oversight and quality assurance, ongoing due diligence of GAI outputs, including proactive management of associated large language models. 2. Access at scale - including investment in digital and critical literacy skills; authentic learning opportunities; higher-order thinking skills; and, peer-based learning - to ensure students donâ€™t simply have â€˜accessâ€™ to GAI but are equipped for a lifetime of considered and appropriate use as citizens.","Learning activities and assessment must be designed with AI in mind, so that AI is less able to be used to do all the thinking for students.","Allow increased flexibility in assessments (particularly at higher grade levels, as lower ones are quite flexible) so schools have the freedom to design assessments and conditions to reduce unethical use of generative AI by students.","there will need to be an education campaign highlighting the benefits of AI as a work and education tool but also the importance of independent, critical and creative thought of being a human.","Publish resources that support students and teachers to become proficient users of AI, including understanding the benefits and limitations.","Support schools with standards of use for AI.","Invest in structured training for classroom staff on the use of GenAI in the classroom and how to educate students about using the technology.","Invest in training and demonstrations for students in the classroom to build literacy and understanding about the benefits and limitations of GenAI and how to best use GenAI tools responsibly.","Formulate strategic priorities and policy for GenAI at the Department level and school level to provide tailored guidance to staff and students.","Upskill and train regulators and policymakers about the opportunities and risks of AI in education, as well as best practice policy and regulatory approaches.","Initiate strong strategic partnerships with relevant government and private stakeholders to codesign solutions for deploying responsible GenAI in classrooms","Consult widely on education system reform with a focus on the impact of emerging technologies on education delivery and assessment.","Ensure existing policy and regulatory frameworks are fit-for-purpose and are able to deliver adequate protections for the use of GenAI in the education system.

This is not just a response to a crisis, as COVID was, but is actually planning for a (hopefully) positive golden age where we really do have robots (both software and hardware) taking care of a lot of the work involved in running society.","The power of AI in the next decade means we have a real opportunity here to use AI to help us reshape education in a way that the very best available education for every citizen is the CLOSEST SCHOOL available with well-paid teachers, excellent resources, and no fees. Note that Iâ€™m not saying AI needs to do all the teaching (it shouldnâ€™t) but that use of AI can help us optimise the use of education funds to support our educators better. Education of people is much more than writing essays, obviously, itâ€™s a whole-body experience that helps the enculturation of our next generations. Our overarching goal (and this really should be apolitical) must be to maximise opportunities for our citizens, propelling us towards a brighter future where all UN Sustainability Goals are achieved.","Professional Development for Educators: Provide professional development opportunities for educators on AI, including understanding its strengths, limitations, data interpretation, and integration into lesson planning and delivery.","Promotion of AI Literacy: Incorporate AI literacy into the curriculum, which includes understanding how AI works, its ethical implications, and how to effectively use AI systems. This also involves developing an AI-Skills Continuum for progressively enhancing students' AI abilities from basic comprehension to problem-solving.","Investment in AI Infrastructure: Provide necessary resources, such as high-speed internet connectivity, robust hardware, and AI software, to support AI integration into education.","Ethical Standards and Privacy Protection: Establish robust ethical standards and guidelines for AI use in education, including stringent student data privacy protection measures and clear rules for AI application in learning and assessments.","Encourage Collaboration: Foster collaboration among tech companies, educators, and policymakers to ensure AI tools meet educational needs effectively and ethically.","Regulation of AI Tools: Implement strict regulations and quality standards for AI tools in education, including a rigorous certification process for new AI applications.","Shift in Learning Paradigms: Advocate for a transition from traditional outcome-based education to a problem-solving, learner-centric approach, facilitated by AI. This includes adjusting pedagogical and assessment strategies to suit the capabilities of AI.","Inclusive and Accessible AI Design: Prioritise inclusivity and accessibility in AI tool design, catering to students with diverse abilities, learning styles, and backgrounds.","Continuous Research and Evaluation: Encourage ongoing research into AI's impact on educational outcomes, including longitudinal studies to understand its long-term effects.","Promotion of Mastery and Engagement: Use AI to create personalised, engaging learning experiences, including game-based learning and real-world problem-solving tasks.","Increased Student Autonomy: Encourage greater student control over their learning journey through the use of AI tools.","Reduced Curriculum Content Load: Shift focus from covering extensive content to mastering key concepts and skills, facilitated by AI's personalised learning capabilities. This may require a review and potential revision of existing curricula","DECYP believes there is a need for a sustainable and adaptable response to generative AI in learning, teaching and assessment, and academic integrity policies and procedures. There will need to be ongoing education and training for students on how to appropriately use generative AI, should use become more commonplace. Detection technology capable of discerning between human and generative AI, e.g. Turnitin, will also need to continue developing and adapting.","OES recommends the Australian Government funds a sector-wide re-skilling and upskilling program to ensure educators are given opportunities to become AI literate, and conversant with general technologies and specific programs. This in turn will enable educators to become confident in understanding the equity and ethical issues and how best to integrate AI tools and capabilities into emerging pedagogic practices.","That the Australian Government prioritises the access to Gen AI opportunities across the population, and that students traditionally in underrepresented areas are not further disadvantaged as we seek to ramp up our literacy into this new domain.","Recommendations to manage the risks, seize the opportunities, and guide the potential development of generative AI tools including in the area of standards.\nâ€¢ OES recommends the Australian Government establish a funding mechanism to:\nâ€¢ fund AI literacy skills and knowledge development within the primary, secondary and tertiary education workforces\nâ€¢ fund the national deployment of AI software, tools and capabilities within the primary and secondary school, with a commitment to provide sufficient additional support to schools currently subject to digital disadvantage","OES recommends the Australian Government develop an integrated and comprehensive strategy to facilitate and equip the vocational and higher education sectors to develop the organisational infrastructure and capacity and skilled workforce required to teach foundational Al language model literacy skills to the public","Further, as Al tools and capabilities, when properly utilised will enable the Austra lian economy to unlock greater productivity and jump-step economic growth, OES recommends the Australian Government develop a comprehensive strategy that will encourages Australian industry to integrate Al language models and tools into operations. This will incentivise employers to upskill their workforce with the general and industry-specific Al skills necessary to engage productively with Al models and
